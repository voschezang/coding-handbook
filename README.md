**Perspective & Generalizability of Guidelines**

[Source](https://twitter.com/johncutlefish/status/1406534814673477633)

1. **Generic** but subjective.
    - Theory, Principle, doctrine, culture.
    - Implicit, feeling, *can be sensed*.
    - Difficult to prove or falsify.
    - Applicable always and anywhere.
2. Objective but **specific**.
    - Practice, habit, skill.
    - Explicit, Concrete, *measurable*, *actionable*.
    - Provable, falsifiable.
    - Applicable to a single moment or location.

E.g. a goal can be short-term and precise, or long-term but vague.



Definition of *anti-pattern*: a commonly used bad solution to some problem. Possibly just an indicator, signaling a deeper issue.
