# Behaviour

Behaviour of objects and forces.



Types

- **Unintended** behaviour. Behaviour is initiated by an external (attractive) force. The subject is passive.
- **Intended** behaviour. Behaviour is initiated by the subject.
    - **Reactive** behaviour.
        - **Immersive** behaviour. The intent is to decrease difference between the other. The other is perceived to have high quality.
        - **Distancing** behaviour. The intent is to increase difference with the other. The other is perceived to have low quality.
    - **Anticipating** behaviour. The intent is based on higher-order effects, rather than direct effects.
        - **Pro-active** behaviour. The intent is decoupled from a stimulus. The intent is to position one to areas with high quality. 
        - **Avoiding** behaviour. The intent is increase distance to a specific area with low quality. It is not based on a specific forward direction.
