An example at organization level.

- An organization *needs* to provide value to shareholders.
- It *values* a competitive advantage, to ensure profitability.
- It *desires* high efficiency as the main method to outperform competitors.
- It *fears* inefficiency waste and under-utilization of resources.
- The resulting *behaviour* could be to:
    - Maximize resource utilization, which could result in over-production.
    - Control employee performance, which could limit autonomy and may impact motivation.
