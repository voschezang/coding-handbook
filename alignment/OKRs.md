# Objectives & Key Results

> When I go forwards you go backwards - and somewhere we will meet.

OKRs are a framework that address the challenge of making objectives on the on hand aspirational and motivational, and on the other hand tangible and specific. Of keeping objectives time-bound, while also pursuing long-term targets. OKRs can be defined per product and target market, but also on an individual level.

**Mission**
Why does this organization exist. A *persistent*, long term goal.

**Objective**
That <u>what you want</u> to achieve in the next quarter or year. A time-bound, *qualitative* goal that is ambitious, inspirational and motivational.

- (for projects) A target state that differs from the current state.
- This can be an hypothesis.

**Key Results**
<u>How you know</u> that you are achieving the objective. *Quantitative* goals that are [measurable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria). These are results of actions that you might take, not the actions themselves.

- They should be so optimistic that only 2/3 of them will be reached.

- These may be time-based. E.g. the churn-rate at a given date.
- (for projects) Target conditions that need to be satisfied in order to reach the target state.

Assign a confidence score to each key result track progress.

**Initiative**
An action that will bring you closer to a result. These should be flexible, in order to be able to respond to surprises.

- E.g. steps that can be taken in sequence to reach target states.

**Risks**
Similar to [MBO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_by_objectives), there is a risk of optimizing for metrics (proxies), instead than targets. This is countered by choosing new metrics (KRs) periodically and chaining them to qualitative objectives.

**Health Indicators**
Perpetual objectives or metrics that are kept stable. Any change induced by the current set OKRs should not degrade these.

#### Guide

How to design OKRs, given an initial idea.

1. Exploration
   1. Define the problem space and the desired state.
   2. List realistic and unrealistic goals.
   3. List potential initiatives that are realistic
2. Exploitation
   1. Narrow down the objective.
   2. Deconstruct the desired state into key results.
