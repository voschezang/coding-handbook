# Control & Guidance

Control implies structure. It attempts to avoid disorder and uncertainty. An alternative to control are incentives. These stimulate "right" behaviour.

## Dual model

There are two seemingly opposite philosophies to achieve alignment. See also [leadership styles](./leadership-styles.md).

1. 🎛️ **Control**. A direct, brute-force approach that uses *power* to obtain control. It relies on rules and directives.
2. 🧭 **Guidance**. A softer, indirect style that uses *empowerment*. It involves receptivity, facilitation and incentives.

These approaches use a variety of tools. Organizations tend to mix tools from both styles in different situations.

|                | Control           | Guidance                             |
| -------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **Small team** | 🗣️ Direct, command | 👂 Conversations                      |
| **Large team** | 👮‍♂️ Roles, rules   | 🚧 Guidelines, procedures, incentives |
| **Few teams**  | 🪜 Hierarchy       | 📈Metrics                             |
| **Many teams** | 🏛️ Institutions    | 📄 Abstraction. Vision & strategies.  |

Guidance requires a different perspective than control. It's rooted in acceptance, rather than toleration.

## Practice

|                 | Control            | Guidance              |
| --------------- | ------------------ | --------------------- |
| **Core**        | Objectives         | Positioning           |
| **Consistency** | Rules, procedures. | Habits, practice.     |
| **Method**      | Targets            | Vision. A north star. |
| **Optimize**    | Results            | Likelihood            |

Rules have (un)expected side effects. Incentives are designed for side-effects. This is similar to positional chess strategies, where you think 3 steps ahead. Incentives focus on improving the likelihood of desired behaviour.

Incentives rely on attitude (intent). *Make it easy to do X.*

Policies are enforced. *Make it mandatory to do X.*

## Light Analogy

The world of particles (targets) and waves (harmony). Inspired by the duality of of [light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave%E2%80%93particle_duality). 

### Particle view

Control specific objects. Move them exactly where you want them to be.

- Use rules and laws to improve stabilty.

- Choose initiatives that have the best return on investment.

### Waves view

See [waves](../math/waves.md). This view revolves around positioning & guidance. The world of probability. Increase the likelihood of desirable events.

- Make it easy to do the right thing. Rely on practice for consistency.

- Bet on initiatives that are likely to improve your position.
