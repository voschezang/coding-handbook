## Introduction

Changes in intent may follows three directions: continuation, deviation and rejection. See [activity](activity.md) and [change](../subjects/change.md).

## Dimensions

> Anything beyond 60 days is directional

Every intent assumes four dimensions: a result, form, time horizon and scale. Each dimension can be mixed. E.g. visions, strategies or sprint goals use different combinations.

| Dimension | Close (precise)              | Far (course)                      |
| --- | :-- | --: |
| **Target**  | ⚙️ Effort (procedural) | Outcome (impact) 📈               |
| **Form**             | 🎯 Concrete (tangible)        | Abstract (motivational) 🧭      |
| **Time horizon**     | ⏱️ Short term                 | Long term 📅                    |
| **Scale / leverage** | 🔍 Local improvements       | Global effects (worldwide) 🌍 |
