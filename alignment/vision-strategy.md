# Vision & Strategy Documents

Most of the concepts surrounding strategy emerge from collaboration and experience. For brevity, we focus on the artefacs of such work: vision and strategy documents. It excludes *adaption* them.

## Overview

Consider the following artifacts.

- Guidelines (procedures and runbooks) are the most specific.
- Strategy documents consider specific constraints, but present systematic solutions.
- Vision documents are idealistic. They go beyond constraints.

|               | Runbook              | Strategy                        | Vision                                 |
| ------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Style**     | Accurate, procedural | Accurate, directive, systematic | Aspirational. Gentle pressure.         |
| **Scope**     | Operations           | Flexible                        | Long-term, potential                   |
| **Bias**      | Problem-oriented     | Problem-oriented                | Opportunity-oriented                   |
| **Focus**     | Specific results     | Specific constraints            | Relational. Attract people towards ... |
| **Frequency** | One for each task    | As many as desired              | As few as possible                     |



## Examples

For operational teams

- Runbooks: operational excellence
- Team vision: gentle code of behaviour
- Product strategy: how & what - value delivery



For management teams

- Runbooks: HR processes, audit processes etc.
- Product strategies. For a specific product, market.
- Organizational strategy: manage competition, delivery
- Organizational vision: relations, long term direction, identity



## Structure

Runbooks, strategy and vision documents benefit from a fixed structure. It is best to keep them brief, and use external documents to dive into details, designs and edge cases.



Runbook

1. Expectation. Pre- and post-conditions.
2. Steps.



Strategy document

- **Diagnosis**. Problem statement. Challenges & constraints.
- **Policies**. Guidelines for decision making. Priorities. This may be treated as justification for actions.
  - Great policies will be controversial (otherwise they wouldnâ€™t be needed).
  - Define a time to revisit it. Long enough to be able to see the desired effects. Don't adapt the policy before then, to avoid premature conclusions.
- **Actions**. Steps to undertake. A result of applying policies to the diagnosis.



Vision document

- **Vision statement**. The core message in 1-2 sentences.
- Narrative. A captivating story that covers:
  - The **value proposition**. Taking into account value for customers or partners.
  - The **capabilities** necessary to deliver the value proposition.
