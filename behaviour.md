# Behaviour

The explanation of the statements and references on this page is left as an exercise to the reader. References to [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:About) are chosen for convenience.

The following statements are patterns of [drift](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/drift), based on observed behaviour.



**Self**

* People tend to acknowledge past personal growth but underestimate or disregard [future personal growth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-of-history_illusion). I.e. the idea that the current state and circumstances are constant until the end of history.
* People tend to explain (attribute) positive and negative events [differently](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-serving_bias).
* We (individuals and organizations) overestimate what we can do in a year and [underestimate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Amara) what we can do in ten years.
  * This effect is stronger for personal goals and important plans/projects/strategies/objectives. As a result we may be better at estimating the future of others than our own.
  * And we keep doing this after recognizing the discrepancy. "That was an exception / This time is different".
* Optimism is rational: it enhances self-esteem and self-efficacy and improves persistence [[1]][1].
* [Confidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect) does not imply competence, but is [related](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_stages_of_competence) to it.



**Statistics**

* Many results are distributed as a [power law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_distribution), where 80% of the results are caused by 20% of the participants.
* The average of averages [follows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem) a normal distribution (bell curve).
* Anything that can go wrong [will go wrong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy%27s_law) (eventually).



**Bureaucracy & Management**

* (In technology) there are people who understand what they do not manage and people who manage what they don't understand.
  * In bureaucratic organizations, people are promoted until they are no longer [competent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_principle) at their jobs.
  * Threatened leaders are incentivized to [promote incompetence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_selection_(politics)) and [get rid of competitors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tall_poppy_syndrome).

* Regulation and bureaucracy incentivize [gamesmanship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamesmanship) over sportsmanship.

* Bureaucratic organizations don't accept [sunk costs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost).



**Market dynamics & game theory**

* The demand upon a (free) resource tends to expand to match the supply of the resource.
    * (Process) work [expands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_law) to fill the time available for its completion.
    * Data expands to [fill the space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox) available for storage.
* In the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run, it's's a [weighing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient-market_hypothesis) machine.
* News is by definition random.
    * In an efficient market, stock prices depend on news and thus [evolve randomly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk_hypothesis).



**Other**

* Evolutions of ideas often follow the [triads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectic#Hegelian_dialectic) `thesis–antithesis–synthesis`, or `problem-reaction-solution` or `abstract-negative-concrete` (rather than more [convoluted cycles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hype_cycle)).
