# Behaviour

The explanation of the statements and references on this page is left as an exercise to the reader.

The following statements are patterns of [drift](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/drift), based on observed behaviour.

**Self**

* People tend to acknowledge past personal growth but underestimate or disregard [future personal growth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-of-history_illusion). I.e. the idea that the current state and circumstances are constant until the end of history.
* People tend to [overestimate](predictive irrationality) desires when needful and underestimate desires when satisfied.
* People tend to explain (attribute) positive and negative events [differently](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-serving_bias).
  * [Loss aversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_aversion) is rational in case of diminishing returns.
* We (individuals and organizations) overestimate what we can do in a year and [underestimate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Amara) what we can do in ten years.
  * This effect is stronger for personal goals and important plans/projects/strategies/objectives. As a result we may be better at estimating the future of others than our own.
  * And we keep doing this after recognizing the discrepancy. "That was an exception / This time is different".
* Belief
  * Bias to believe what one wants to believe.
  * Social belief: trust in what the majority beliefs.
  * People tend to belief past events were "bound to happen" or even were "by design".
* Humans fear uncertainty.
  * Consequently, they put their faith in some idea, and even double down on it.
* Many decision are driven by *fear*. E.g. the fear of risk, or the fear of missing out.
* [Confidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect) does not imply competence, but is [related](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_stages_of_competence) to it.
* Each person is unique cannot be compared. Comparing them reduces them to a single metric. The same is true for groups
  * [Identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_(philosophy)) is fluid and [ill-defined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difference_(philosophy)).

**Bureaucracy & Management**

* (In technology) there are people who understand what they do not manage and people who manage what they don't understand.
  * In bureaucratic organizations, people are promoted until they are no longer [competent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_principle) at their jobs.
  * Threatened leaders are incentivized to [promote incompetence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_selection_(politics)) and [get rid of competitors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tall_poppy_syndrome).
  
* Regulation and bureaucracy incentivize [gamesmanship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamesmanship) over sportsmanship.

* Bureaucratic organizations don't accept [sunk costs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost).

* Groups tend to develop [herd mentalities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_mentality) and [groupthink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupthink).

* Humans prefer certainty and absolutes over stochasticity and complexity. They tend to underestimate variance (e.g. by setting a *just* a mean expectation). An alternative would be [mean-variance analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_portfolio_theory).

* Bias for status quo.

  * Changes are evaluated critically, while addressing problems the current state is postponed

  * Evaluate outcome instead of process, resulting in a bias for luck

  * Asymmetries in rewards.

    * Stronger (desire for) punishment of faulty action than inaction
    * Tendency to punish bad decisions but don’t reward good ones

**Market dynamics & game theory**

* The demand upon a (free) resource tends to expand to match the supply of the resource.
  * (Process) work [expands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_law) to fill the time available for its completion.
  * Data expands to [fill the space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox) available for storage.
  * A requirement to be 100% busy incentivizes people to look busy.
    * Note that a highway that is at 100% capacity is far from effective.
* The market is a *voting* machine In the short run, but a [*weighing*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient-market_hypothesis) machine in the long run.
* News is by definition [random](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_content).
  * In an efficient market, stock prices depend on news and thus [evolve randomly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk_hypothesis).
* Bias: optimize things that are measured.

**Other**

* Evolutions of ideas often follow the [triads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectic#Hegelian_dialectic) `thesis–antithesis–synthesis`, or `problem-reaction-solution` or `abstract-negative-concrete` (rather than more [convoluted cycles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hype_cycle)). Another example is the [three-act structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-act_structure) in theater.
* Belief is based on usefulness rather than truthiness.
* Ambiguity in specifications implies conflict. People tend to blame themselves for their limited understanding, instead of objectively criticizing the specification. They'll try to make up for it by working harder (instead of addressing the underlying issue).
* It takes decennia to build a reputation but only 1 incident to ruin it.
* Bias for efficiency. Take a step back when you hear the term *efficiency* and consider what the unintended side effects could be.
* People tend to have more empathy for individuals (usually closer to them) than for groups of individuals.
