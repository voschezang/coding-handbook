# Behaviour

The explanation of the statements and references on this page is left as an exercise to the reader.

The following statements are patterns of [drift](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/drift), based on observed behaviour.



**Self**

* People tend to acknowledge past personal growth but underestimate or disregard [future personal growth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-of-history_illusion). I.e. the idea that the current state and circumstances are constant until the end of history.
* People tend to explain (attribute) positive and negative events [differently](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-serving_bias).
* We (individuals and organizations) overestimate what we can do in a year and [underestimate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Amara) what we can do in ten years.
  * This effect is stronger for personal goals and important plans/projects/strategies/objectives. As a result we may be better at estimating the future of others than our own.
  * And we keep doing this after recognizing the discrepancy. "That was an exception / This time is different".
* Optimism is rational: it enhances self-esteem and self-efficacy and improves persistence [[1]][1]. [Embrace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amor_fati) your environment rather than complaining about it.
    * "Nothing ventured, nothing gained"
* [Confidence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect) does not imply competence, but is [related](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_stages_of_competence) to it.
* Many decision are driven by *fear*. E.g. the fear of risk, or the fear of missing out.
* Each person is unique cannot be compared. Comparing them reduces them to a single metric. The same is true for groups
    * [Identity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identity_(philosophy)) is fluid, [ill-defined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difference_(philosophy)) and tends to change and adapt.
* Success: you or your ideas need to be either *exceptional* (better than everything else) or *different*.
* [Multiplicity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posthuman) of selves. Identification with each role is dynamic. "I was not myself". Time flies.
* The Self or Subject can be:

    - Aristotle's essence or spirit: our underlying self.
    - Subject of though: Cartesian Ego (observer of the world, body as an interface).

    - [Being-in-the-world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dasein): the coherence of the self and the reset of the world.



**Bureaucracy & Management**

* (In technology) there are people who understand what they do not manage and people who manage what they don't understand.
  * In bureaucratic organizations, people are promoted until they are no longer [competent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_principle) at their jobs.
  * Threatened leaders are incentivized to [promote incompetence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_selection_(politics)) and [get rid of competitors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tall_poppy_syndrome).
* Regulation and bureaucracy incentivize [gamesmanship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamesmanship) over sportsmanship.
* Bureaucratic organizations don't accept [sunk costs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost).
* Groups tend to develop [herd mentalities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_mentality) and [groupthink](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupthink).
* Humans prefer certainty and absolutes over stochasticity and complexity. They tend to underestimate variance (e.g. by setting a *just* a mean expectation).



**Market dynamics & game theory**

* The demand upon a (free) resource tends to expand to match the supply of the resource.
    * (Process) work [expands](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_law) to fill the time available for its completion.
    * Data expands to [fill the space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox) available for storage.
* The market is a *voting* machine In the short run, but a [*weighing*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient-market_hypothesis) machine in the long run.
* News is by definition [random](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_content).
    * In an efficient market, stock prices depend on news and thus [evolve randomly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk_hypothesis).



**Other**

* Evolutions of ideas often follow the [triads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialectic#Hegelian_dialectic) `thesis–antithesis–synthesis`, or `problem-reaction-solution` or `abstract-negative-concrete` (rather than more [convoluted cycles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hype_cycle)). Another example is the [three-act structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-act_structure) in theater.
* Ambiguity in specifications implies conflict. People tend to blame themselves for their limited understanding, instead of objectively criticizing the specification. They'll try to make up for it by working harder (instead of addressing the underlying issue).
* It takes decennia to build a reputation but only 1 incident to ruin it.
