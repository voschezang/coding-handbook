# Accountability

**Accountability** is the key factor that distiguishes roles and responsibilities. This document presents a generic model for accountability.

First, let's distinguish the **production** process and its **product**. These yield the first two accountabilities. Production is enabled through **capabilities**. Usually this is a mix of *technical* and *organizational* capability.

Note that all of this is influenced by the external world: the **context**. There is a boundary of things that are in control of the organization. Accountability cannot trancend this boundary.

## Value Chain

> *Build the right thing.*

Delivery of value is modelled by a **value chain**. The end-to-end process. Its aim is to balance the preferences of the organization and customers: *what* is produced.

> Build it right.

The value chain is centered around a **production chain**. This is an internal process that aims to optimize production quality and throughput: *how* it is produced.

## Environment

Value creation is done in an environment. Everything within this environment enables value creation and delivery. The environment is also subject to influence from outside.

Activities that **enable** value creation and delivery

- Manage people and resources
- Remove impediments
- Coach teams
