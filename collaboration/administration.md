# Administration

Administration is a type of documentation that aims to record what happened. 

It has an historical purpose.

- It's not about using structured data or templates. Rather, it's about narrowing down information to it's core.

It has an alignment purpose.

- It provides transparency. It incentivizes discussion and self-reflection.



Benefits

- Empiricism. Be able to look back and find patterns.
- Structure. Work reliably, be able to show contribution and effort.



Key points to register.

- Major changes / challenges / goals.
- Per month / year / decade.



What to document per point

1. The intended purpose of X.
2. The resulting outcome of X.
3. The origin of X.
4. Who participated in X.



## Templates

This is an addition to public documents. 

- Don't copy JIRA, but rather extend it with information that is not suitable for it.



### Static documents

```markdown
# Team Vision
Envision a great future. Conditions of what this entails.
Consider:
- Team success
- Team performance
```



### Historical documents

These describe the system from a specific perspective, at a specific date.


```markdown
# Roadmap
Planned (expected) change. Planned activities.
The path forward. Short and long term.

# Key Signals
Noteworthy observations. Usualy they are interesting enough to warrant a discussion. They may or may not have high priority.

# Key Challenges
Radical change: expected changes to the team, they product or their environment.
- Key problems & risks. Patterns and their results.
- Impediments to team performance and team success.
```
