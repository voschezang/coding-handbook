# Coaching

Coaching is about providing a soundboard, through questioning. It's oriented towards potential and results. It starts with the preferences of the coachee. They are for example responsible for choosing objectives.

## Overview



### Intent & Purpose

Help the coachee achieve the what they want.

Coaching is not limited to planning and goal-setting. It may range from:

- Empathy, recognition
- Provide a soundboard
- Provide a new perspective
- Challenge perceived obstacles
- Show blind spots
- Explore potential
- Choose a next step
- Plan a next step



### Method

Coaching is **result**-oriented. This means:

- Start with a desired result, based on the preference of the coachee. Note that desires may change over time.
- Focus on core desires rather than fears
- Practical steps rather than theory and analysis.
- Let the coachee come up with solutions. Then explore these.
- End conversations with an action point.
- Don't over-analyze problems
- Don't provide solutions.



**Requirements**

Necessary conditions.

- Trust. Which requires:
    - Confidentiality.
    - Clarity.
    - Transparency about context, motivation, interests, other parties.
    - Request approval when approaching boundaries. E.g. for personal questions, giving suggestions.
- Agreement on the coach-coachee relation. 
- Sessions
    - Intake session to align expectations and set an initial objective.
    - Repeated conversational sessions that end with action points.



## Power dynamics

Coaching requires confidentiality. Avoid conflicting interests.

**Anti-pattern**

Coach as a middlemen, between the employee and manager.



## Supporting roles

Coaching focusses on the intersection of the subject and a context. E.g. an organization.

Mentoring focusses on the intersection of the subject and a domain. E.g. a sport or craft.

## Conversations

Note

- First impressions have a strong effect on each other's perception and attitude.
- It takes time and effort to gain trust. Deep personal questions can be inappropriate if there is not enough trust.
- Conversations are about flow, rather than about steps.

For coaching conversations

- The other decides when they're ready to move further.
- Provide choices to the other. Request approval before giving advice, making suggestions, asking personal questions or changing topics.
- Verify assumptions.

**Conversation Flow**

Initially the ambition might not be clear.

- Start with the **context**. Learn about the environment.
- This often touches certain perceived **obstacles**. Listen to these, but do not dwell on them. Put them into perspective, challenge them or look past them. Explore what is possible.
- To look past obstacles it can help to moving the focus to either a **competency** or personal **value**. Emphasize these and explore how they can contribute to the coachee.
- Move back and forth to topics based on intuition. Zoom in and out by exploring (future) **ambition**.
- Eventually, move towards concrete, alternative **behaviour** that could help.
- Let the conversation end with action points. Check whether these match the preferences of the coachee.

These topics focus attention on different aspects of life. They help to associate and dissociate.
