## Conversations



### Difficult Conversations

Three categories of "difficult" conversations:

1. What happened?
2. Emotions
3. Identity. See [organization](organization.md#Identity).



#### What happened?

Anti-pattern

- Belief: I'm right and you're wrong. 
- Goal: Convince the other.

Solution: Take a learning stance.

- Belief: Both perspectives are valid.
- Goal:  Learn to understand the other's perspective. Find a shared interest or purpose



Anti-pattern

- Belief: It's their fault.
- Goal: Justification.

Solution.

- Belief: Both parties contributed in some way.
- Goal: Figure out how this happened. Share my perspective; what happened and the effect on me.



#### Emotions

In general, emotions are normal and they can be expressed gradually.

Anti-pattern

- Emotions are excluded from the conversation entirely.
- Conversations are overly emotional.



### Emotional Conversations

Types of emotional conversations ([NVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolent_Communication)).

- Self-empathy. Noticing the thoughs and feelings of the self - without judgement.
- Receiving empathically. Connecting with the other. Immersing fully with the other - without interpreting or understanding them.
- Expressing honestly. By default, this would involve an observation, feeling, need AND a request. See [communication](communication.md)
