# Human Communication

These models are valid for specific circumstances. I.e. professional communication within a corporate setting. They are useful for collaborative interaction and trustworthy relations. See also [requirements engineering](../organization/requirements.md) and [documentation](../documentation.md).

[toc]

General principles

- "**Right**" communication depends on the listener, the environment and your history.
- There is **always** communication. Even being absent or silent sends a message.
- Human communication is extremely **noisy** and inefficient.

## Attitude & Relation

**Attitude**

To make communication more effective.

- **Optimism** and trust is more productive (for collaboration) than pessimism and distrust.
  - Most behaviour can be explained by positive intent and [bounded rationality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounded_rationality)
  - Strive for a 5:1 ratio for positive and negative feedback.
  
- Make reversible decisions *eagerly* and irreversible decisions *conservatively*.
- **Lazy** evaluations. Don't jump to details. Collect information before stopping at a decision.
  - Lead with Why, rather than How.
  - Align and decide on the problem, then the solution, and only then the implementation.
  - Allow the other to change their position.
- Embrace **uncertainty** and sensitivity.
  - Assume that there are multiple unknowns.
  - Address ambiguity and uncertainty. Call it out.
  - Acknowledge emotions and make them explicit, rather than suppressing them.

**Context: Relation**

Which role you are expected to take. This is determined by your history and the start of the interaction.

- Leader. Steering, setting examples and standards. Being responsible.
- Facilitator.
- Mediator, negotiator.
- Coach, mentor.
- Teacher.
- Expert. Advising. Give an objective opinion.
- Manager. Asking questions, deciding

## Behaviour

- Inside, outside, other side
- Four-sides message model

Patterns

- Forms / channels of communication
- Attitude: sub-assertive, assertive, aggressive
- Bridging - mediating - negotiating

### Models

#### Communication Pyramid

Layered model for conversations: step by step.

1. Personality
2. Expertise
3. Style
4. (Deep) Content

#### State of Mind

Attention can be directed towards auditory, kinesthetic or visual senses. It can be focused internally or externally. This table excludes the senses taste and smell.

| Representational System | Sense    | Internal Focus       | External Focus      |
| ----------------------- | -------- | -------------------- | ------------------- |
| Auditory                | Hearing  | Thought (linguistic) | Sound (hearing)     |
| Kinesthetic             | Feelings | Sensation (emotion)  | Vibe, energy        |
| Visual                  | Sight    | Mental images        | The world (spatial) |

#### Subjectivity: In/Out/Other-side

> "Good" communiction depends on all three components

Miscommunication is often caused by mistranslations.

Components

- Inside. E.g. beliefs, emotions, thoughts, physical sensation.
- Outside. Content, voice, body language.
- Other-side. Any filters/biases of the other.

Relation

- Transparency: from inside to outside.
- Feedback: from other to outside.

#### Four-sides Model

Messages send from a sender to a receiver consist of [four aspects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-sides_model):

- Subjective
  - Self-revealing or self-disclosing aspect.
  - Appeal. A wish or want related to the other.

- Objective
  - Factual aspect
  - Relational aspect

Aligning these aspects keeps the message pure and avoids miscommunication. Mixed messages may be interpreted in an unexpected way. See [meta-communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-communication).

#### Subjective Events

Events have subjective effects. This can create tension and conflict. Merely understanding the nature of such conflict can resolve it. Multiple perspectives can be right at the same time.

An event can be deconstructed into three fundamental parts:

1. The **intent** of the actor.
2. The **impact**. What happened.
3. The **effect** this had on the other. E.g. emotionally.

<img src="../img/intent-impact-effect.png" alt="intent-impact-effect" style="width:40%;" />

Incorporating these factors puts a *positional* argument into perspective.

E.g.

- A positional argument may have the form: "Why did you do *this* to me?!" "I didn't! I wanted to do *that*!"

- Deconstructing the positions into an *effect* and an *intent* shows that both perspective are right, at the same time.

### Patterns

#### Forms of communication

Channels

- **Email**. Ideals for broadcasts (one-to-many). Suitable for one-directional communication such as status updates. Useful as a conversation starter, rather than a one-directional channel.
- **Phone** call. Ideal for quick feedback.
- **Meeting**. Multi-purpose. E.g. explore options, improve group relationships, determine the right approach. See [management-principles](../management/management-principles.md)
- **In-person** meeting. Emphasis on attitude and off-topic subjects.

Specific forms

- **Absence** of silence. This may send a mixed messages. It may be interpreted in many different ways.
- **Presence** and attention. E.g. to show support.

#### Level of assertiveness

- Ideal behaviour: find a balance based on each other's boundaries.
- Assertiveness is the expression of self-worth (dignity).

|                            | Sub-assertive                     | Assertive                       | Aggressive                    |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Directness and respect** | Indirect                          | Direct + respect                | Direct - respect              |
| **Relation and goal**      | Relation > goal                   | Relation + goal                 | Goal > relation               |
| **Boundaries**             | Lowering boundaries               | Maintaining boundaries          | Over-stepping boundaries      |
| **Flexibility**            | Too agreeable                     | Authentic. In line with desire. | Too defensive                 |
| **Behaviour**              | Too careful (slow)                | Attentive. Reconsidering.       | Too eager (fast)              |
| **Responsibility**         | Avoiding. <br />Over-apologizing. | Taking responsibility.          | Rejecting. Accusing. Blaming. |

## Feedback

Anti-patterns

- Hamburger. A negative message hidden within fake compliments.
- Hit and run. Push feedback onto someone and then leave.



## Background

**Ambiguity**

[Natural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language) language is fundamentally flawed. It is ambiguous and it's meaning dependents on context and history. Surface-level language can be deconstructed to get closer to the true (deeper) meaning.

Anti-patterns & logical [fallacies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy) & [biases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_bias):

- Unspecified noun. *"This decision was made"* - by whom?
- Unspecified verb. *"They moved"*.  - how?
- Comparisons. *"It is better"* - what is the baseline?
- Judgements. *"Clearly, this is true"* - by who's authority?
- Nominalization. Using adjectives or verbs as nouns. *"The state of education "* - where are the nouns?
- Modal operators of possibility. *"It is impossible"* - in what conditions? what stops you?
- Modal operators of necessity. *"This should be done"* - what if? what happens if it doesn't?
- Universal quantifiers. (Over-)generalizations. *"Always"* - what are the exceptions?
- Complex equivalence. *"If-then"* - why does this implication hold?
- Pressuppositions. Assumptions. What leads to you to belief that?
- Cause and effect. Instead of attribution.
- Mind reading. E.g. projection of ones own feelings onto someone else, assuming an intent is obvious. - how exactly do you know?

**Emotions**

Bottled up emotions build up and can create tension. Risks:

- This tension influences conversations by “leaking through”.
- The emotions reduce the capability for (active) listening. Truly listening requires an open mindset.
- Risk of “explosions”.
