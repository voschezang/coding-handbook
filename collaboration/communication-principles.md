# Human Communication

These models are valid for specific circumstances. I.e. professional communication within a corporate setting. They are useful for collaborative interaction and trustworthy relations. See also [requirements engineering](../management/requirements-engineering.md) and [documentation](../documentation.md).

[toc]

General principles

- "**Right**" communication depends on the listener, the environment and your history.
- There is **always** communication. Even being absent or silent sends a message.
- Human communication is extremely **noisy** and inefficient.



## Attitude & Relation

**Attitude**

To make communication more effective.

- **Optimism** and trust is more productive (for collaboration) than pessimism and distrust.
  - Most behaviour can be explained by positive intent and [bounded rationality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounded_rationality)

- Make reversible decisions *eagerly* and irreversible decisions *conservatively*.
- **Lazy** evaluations. Don't jump to details. Collect information before stopping at a decision.
  - Lead with Why, rather than How.
  - Align and decide on the problem, then the solution, and only then the implementation.
  - Allow the other to change their position.
- Embrace **uncertainty** and sensitivity.
  - Assume that there are multiple unknowns.
  - Address ambiguity and uncertainty. Call it out.
  - Acknowledge emotions and make them explicit, rather than suppressing them.

**Context: Relation**

Which role you are expected to take. This is determined by your history and the start of the interaction.

- Leader. Steering, setting examples and standards. Being responsible.
- Facilitator.
- Mediator, negotiator.
- Coach, mentor.
- Teacher.
- Expert. Advising. Give an objective opinion.
- Manager. Asking questions, deciding

### Models

#### Communication Triangle

**Definition**

Communication consists of more than a message (content). Two pillars are necessary in order to communicate a message: *process* and *relation*.

- Process (form). In what ways is communication expected to take place. Any etiquette and formalities.
- Relation. How the parties relate to each other. How they feel about each other. Incl. their history and any power dynamics.

A fourth component is *context*. This affects the meaning of each point.

**Conversation Flow**

Move naturally between corners for a good, balanced conversation flow. Avoid dwelling too long on a single aspect.

**Perspectives**

First, second, third position.

1. The self. I, how I see/feel/hear it.
2. The other, with whom I interact.  How they see/hear/feel
3. An outside view. Someone who’s not involved. “Objective”



#### State of Mind

Attention can be directed towards auditory, kinesthetic or visual senses. It can be focused internally or externally. This table excludes the senses taste and smell.

| Representational System | Sense    | Internal Focus       | External Focus      |
| ----------------------- | -------- | -------------------- | ------------------- |
| Auditory                | Hearing  | Thought (linguistic) | Sound (hearing)     |
| Kinesthetic             | Feelings | Sensation (emotion)  | Vibe, energy        |
| Visual                  | Sight    | Mental images        | The world (spatial) |

**Confidence, comfort and manageability**

The mind is influenced by thoughts, feelings, behaviour and external influences. The estimation to what extend this is manageable influences the physiological response (e.g. stress).

#### Subjectivity: In/Out/Other-side

> "Good" communiction depends on all three components

Miscommunication is often caused by mistranslations.

Components

- Inside. E.g. beliefs, emotions, thoughts, physical sensation.
- Outside. Content, voice, body language.
- Other-side. Any filters/biases of the other.

Relation

- Transparency: from inside to outside.
- Feedback: from other to outside.

#### Four-sides Model

Messages send from a sender to a receiver consist of [four aspects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-sides_model):

- Subjective
    - Self-revealing or self-disclosing aspect.
    - Appeal. A wish or want related to the other.

- Objective
    - Factual aspect
    - Relational aspect


Aligning these aspects keeps the message pure and avoids miscommunication. Mixed messages may be interpreted in an unexpected way. See [meta-communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-communication).



#### Subjective Events

Events have subjective effects. This can create tension and conflict. Merely understanding the nature of such conflict can resolve it. Multiple perspectives can be right at the same time.

An event can be deconstructed into three fundamental parts:

1. The **intent** of the actor.
2. The **impact**. What happened.
3. The **effect** this had on the other. E.g. emotionally.

<img src="../img/intent-impact-effect.png" alt="intent-impact-effect" style="width:40%;" />

Incorporating these factors puts a *positional* argument into perspective.

E.g.

- A positional argument may have the form: "Why did you do this to me?!" "I didn't! I wanted to do that!"

- Deconstructing the positions into an *effect* and an *intent* shows that both perspective are right, at the same time.



### Patterns

#### Forms of communication

Channels

- **Email**. Ideals for broadcasts (one-to-many). Suitable for one-directional communication such as status updates. Useful as a conversation starter, rather than a one-directional channel.
- **Phone** call. Ideal for quick feedback.
- **Meeting**. Multi-purpose. E.g. explore options, improve group relationships, determine the right approach. See [management-principles](../management/management-principles.md)
- **In-person** meeting. Emphasis on attitude and off-topic subjects.

Specific forms

- **Absence** of silence. This may send a mixed messages. It may be interpreted in many different ways.
- **Presence** and attention. E.g. to show support.

#### Communication styles

- Ideal behaviour: switch between these based on context and need.

| Pushing                                            | Pulling                                                  |
| -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Taking space                                       | Giving space                                             |
| Goal/content-oriented                              | Relation-oriented                                        |
| Persuading, asserting, incentivizing (sanctioning) | Bridging (involving, listening, disclosing), attracting. |

#### Level of assertiveness

- Ideal behaviour: find a balance based on each other's boundaries.

| Sub-assertive       | Assertive              | Aggressive            |
| ------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------- |
| Indirect            | Direct + respect       | Direct - respect      |
| Relation > goal     | Relation + goal        | Goal > relation       |
| Lowering boundaries | Maintaining boundaries | Going over boundaries |
| Too agreeable       |                        | Too defensive         |

#### Bridging, Mediating, Negotiating

The difference between these can be a matter of framing.

- Ideal behaviour: depends on the role: from collaborating to competing.
- Find a fair deal. Mutual gain, objective criteria.

|      |          | Bridging         | Mediation            | Negotiation         |
| ---- | -------- | ---------------- | -------------------- | ------------------- |
| Why  | Purpose  | Explore needs    | Shared goal.         | Individual goals    |
| What | End-goal | Learn and relate | Mutual gain. Win-win | Zero-sum game       |
| How  | Emphasis | Relation         | Interests            | Emphasize positions |

Framing messages allows positive and negative aspects be emphasized.

| Collaboratively                                  | Competently                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| I think you're right.                            | I knew that already                                          |
| I like that idea.                                | That's unrealistic. <br />That will take forever.<br />I can't do that. |
| I thought X. Can you show me what I'm missing?   | You are wrong.                                               |
| I see some challenges. How would you approach X? | X is a blocker.                                              |

**Addressing Conflict**

- Don't offer a compromise too soon. First aim for a shared understanding of both perspectives. Ensure that the other party understands your problem. Move away from a negotiation-oriented conversation to an open, learning conversation.



## Background

**Ambiguity**

[Natural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language) language is fundamentally flawed. It is ambiguous and it's meaning dependents on context and history. Surface-level language can be deconstructed to get closer to the true (deeper) meaning.

Anti-patterns & logical [fallacies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy) & [biases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_bias):

- Unspecified noun. *"This decision was made"* - by whom?
- Unspecified verb. *"They moved"*.  - how?
- Comparisons. *"It is better"* - what is the baseline?
- Judgements. *"Clearly, this is true"* - by who's authority?
- Nominalization. Using adjectives or verbs as nouns. *"The state of education "* - where are the nouns?
- Modal operators of possibility. *"It is impossible"* - in what conditions? what stops you?
- Modal operators of necessity. *"This should be done"* - what if? what happens if it doesn't?
- Universal quantifiers. (Over-)generalizations. *"Always"* - what are the exceptions?
- Complex equivalence. *"If-then"* - why does this implication hold?
- Pressuppositions. Assumptions. What leads to you to belief that?
- Cause and effect. Instead of attribution.
- Mind reading. E.g. projection of ones own feelings onto someone else, assuming an intent is obvious. - how exactly do you know?

**Emotions**

Bottled up emotions build up and can create tension. Risks:

- This tension influences conversations by “leaking through”.
- The emotions reduce the capability for (active) listening. Truly listening requires an open mindset.
- Risk of “explosions”.
