# Communication Styles

[toc]

## Overview

Communication is dynamic, rather than static. It flows between pushing and pulling, and between goals and relation. You can take space and later give it back.



## Direction

Communication can focus on moving forward (towards a goal), connecting to each other, or to slow down and reconsider. See [change](../subjects/change.md). Also see [styles](https://www.zuidema.nl/blog/stijlflexibiliteit-welke-stijl-zet-jij-in-om-effectief-te-communiceren).

### Pushing

Communication styles that help you move forward. Take in space. Emphasize ratio. Focus on content.

- **Asserting**. Make deliberate statements. Do this carefully, with precision. E.g. use:
  - Evualuations. *"That was good"*
  - Expectations. *"I expect X when Y"*
  - Consequences. "If X, then Y"
- **Persuading**. Use layers of arguments to strenghten your case. E.g. use
  - Proposals. *"I propose that ..."*
  - Reasons and facts. *"Because ..."*



Shared understanding --- persuade / change direction purpose

|            | üí° Asserting           | üó£Ô∏è Persuading                     |
| ---------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Method** | Statements            | Reasoning                        |
| **Focus**  | Shared understanding  | Judgement. Actions and decisions |
| **Scope**  | Context. Where we are | Goal. Where to go                |



### Pulling

Communication styles that emphasize connection. Invite the other to come closer.

|              | üí° Overcome difference                      | üëÇ Reduce difference     |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| **Why**      | Find a shared purpose. Find common ground. | Connect to each other.  |
| **What**     | Inspire, motivate                          | Empathize               |
| **Attitude** | Enthusiasm                                 | Curious,                |
| **Style**    | High energy, great ideas                   | Intimate, compassionate |
| **Method**   | Tell stories, envision possibilities.      | Ask, listen, disclose.  |

Connecting to the other may involve:

- Active listening. Verbally and non-verbally. Asking follow-up questions.
- Summarizing or paraphrasing what was said.
- Mentioning what you see. Suggesting evaluations.
- Disclosing. Express what you feel.



## Bridging, Mediating, Negotiating

The difference between these can be a matter of framing.

- Ideal behaviour: depends on the role: from collaborating to competing.
- Find a fair deal. Mutual gain, objective criteria.

|      |          | Bridging         | Mediation            | Negotiation         |
| ---- | -------- | ---------------- | -------------------- | ------------------- |
| Why  | Purpose  | Explore needs    | Shared goal.         | Individual goals    |
| What | End-goal | Learn and relate | Mutual gain. Win-win | Zero-sum game       |
| How  | Emphasis | Relation         | Interests            | Emphasize positions |

Framing messages allows positive and negative aspects be emphasized.

| Collaboratively                                  | Competently                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| I think you're right.                            | I knew that already                                          |
| I like that idea.                                | That's unrealistic. <br />That will take forever.<br />I can't do that. |
| I thought X. Can you show me what I'm missing?   | You are wrong.                                               |
| I see some challenges. How would you approach X? | X is a blocker.                                              |

**Addressing Conflict**

- Don't offer a compromise too soon. First aim for a shared understanding of both perspectives. Ensure that the other party understands your problem. Move away from a negotiation-oriented conversation to an open, learning conversation.

**Negotiating**

- Distinguish people from problems.
- Emphasize intent and value, rather than positions.
- Show/develop multiple options with varying benefits.
- Use objective criteria, to cultivate an attitude of fairness.
