# Communication Triangle

## Overview

Dimensions

- Result-oriented or people-oriented.
- Focus on the present, focus on the future.
- Command or invite.
- Form or content.



## Components

Communication consists of more than [messages](messaging.md) (i.e. content). Two pillars are necessary in order to communicate a message: *process* and *relation*.

- Process (form). Shared expectations of how to communicate. Any etiquette and formalities.
- Relation. The bond between the participants. How they feel about each other. Including their history and power dynamics.

A fourth component is *context*. This affects the meaning of each point.

**Conversation Flow**

Move naturally between corners for a good, balanced conversation flow. Avoid dwelling too long on a single aspect.



**Perspectives**

First, second, third position.

1. The self. I, how I see/feel/hear it.
2. The other, with whom I interact.  How they see/hear/feel
3. An outside view. Someone who‚Äôs not involved. ‚ÄúObjective‚Äù



## Direction

Communication can focus on moving forward (towards a goal), connecting to each other, or to slow down and reconsider. See [change](../subjects/change.md). Also see [styles](https://www.zuidema.nl/blog/stijlflexibiliteit-welke-stijl-zet-jij-in-om-effectief-te-communiceren).

### Pushing

Communication styles that help you move forward. Take in space. Emphasize ratio. Focus on content.

- **Asserting**. Make deliberate statements. Do this carefully, with precision. E.g. use:
  - Evualuations. *"That was good"*
  - Expectations. *"I expect X when Y"*
  - Consequences. "If X, then Y"
- **Persuading**. Use layers of arguments to strenghten your case. E.g. use
  - Proposals. *"I propose that ..."*
  - Reasons and facts. *"Because ..."*
