# Conflict



In a team

- Visibility of conflict. Elephant in the room.
- Discuss conflict. Transparency.
- Resolve conflict. Integrate difference.



Couples (pairs) tend to react the same way. Styles (like a dance):

- Fight + fight. Explosive.
- Fight + flight. Pursuer and a distances.
- Flight + flight. Shared isolation.



Critique implies a desire. A wish or a need. It often has the form of a negation. E.g.:

- *"You didn't do what you promised"* → desire for conformity / stability.
- *"You're never have time for me"* → desire for attention/ recognition
