# Emotions

> Emotions can be experienced in endlessly new ways.

Emotions are dynamic. They are experienced, rather than fixed. They revolve around quality (liking).

1. Experience ranges from pleasant to unpleasant.
2. Emotions provide a [multiplicity](#Primary%20Emotions) of experience.

Emotions are used as communication devices. Between your body and mind and between yourself and others. In addition, they are highly dependent on the environment and someone's interpretation of it. For example, image the difference between seeing a lion in the zoo or on the street.



## Pleasantness & Activation

From a high level, two dimensions can be  distinguished: **pleasantness** (quality) and **activation** (energy).

Some higher dimensions are guilt, shame and surprise. These reflect (dis)liking of a primary emotion in a certain context.



## Primary Emotions

Emotions communicate *qualities* and personal needs. This communication is directed both towards the self and others.

- Happens indicates quality of pleasure. Sadness indicates the loss of it.
- Anger and fear indicate conflict, disruption and loss of quality. Anger relates to crossing [boundaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_boundaries) and [pushing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression).

Other emotions

- Desire. Love, longing.

- Disgust. From liking to revulse.

- Surprise. From awe to disbelief (skepticism).



### Flow

> Surf the waves of emotions.

Emotions *disrupt* the human body temporarily. After a burst of emotions (e.g. crying or laughing), the human body tends to return to a [balanced state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis). The two extreme deviations of this are an absense of emotions and a persistency of specific emotions. These signal an imbalance. Examples of long-term, persistent emotions are depression, hate and paranoia.



**Avoiding emotions**

> Suppressing takes energy but embracing frees up energy

There are three typical methods to avoid emotions.

- Prevention. Avoid situations that may trigger emotional responses.
- Distraction. Shift attention elsewhere.
- Suppression. Numb emotions.

Avoidance may result in either a less vibrant (numb) life, or in eruptions of emotions at a later point in time. Note that in case of eruptions of emotions, the emotions themselves are merely signals of an underlying problem.
