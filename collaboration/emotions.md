## Emotions

Emotions communicate *qualities* and personal needs. They are  have both personal and social effects.

- Happens indicates quality of pleasure. Sadness indicates the loss of it.
- Anger and fear indicate conflict, disruption and loss of quality. Anger relates to crossing [boundaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_boundaries) and [pushing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression).



Emotions disrupt the human body temporarily. After a burst of emotion, the human body tends to return to a [balanced state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis). Long-term experience of emotions indicate a disruption of this.

- Short-term: Bursts of emotions. E.g. cry or laugh.
- Long-term: Persistent emotions. E.g. depression, hate, paranoia.
