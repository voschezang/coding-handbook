# Emotions

Emotions are hidden well in corporate environments. They are preceded by objectives and goals. Emotions themselves may be framed as concerns or frustration. Awareness of emotions may allow you to use (and trust) them.

## Attitude

> Emotions need attention

Emotions want to be recognized. People want to feel heard. Emotions themselves signal problems. Ignoring them creates problems.

> Emotions require expression

It's human nature to express emotions. Doing this appropriately allows you to become aware of the underlying problems. Once emotions are expressed they can be resolved. 



## Problems

Typical problems are related to planning and scheduling. However, there might be underlying emotions that are overlooked. Recognizing these may help to accept reality, reduce stress and improve effectiveness.

Some emotions have multiple sides. E.g. critique can come from a deeper desire to change something.
