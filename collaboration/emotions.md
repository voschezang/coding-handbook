# Emotions

> Emotions can be experienced in endlessly new ways.

Emotions are dynamic. They are experienced, rather than fixed.

1. Experience ranges from [pleasant](#Experience) to unpleasant.
2. Emotions provide a [multiplicity](#Emotions) of experience.

Emotions are used as communication devices. Between your body and mind and between yourself and others.



## Experience

We can distinguish two dimensions: **pleasantness** and **activation**.

## Emotions

Emotions communicate *qualities* and personal needs. They are  have both personal and social effects.

- Happens indicates quality of pleasure. Sadness indicates the loss of it.
- Anger and fear indicate conflict, disruption and loss of quality. Anger relates to crossing [boundaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_boundaries) and [pushing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression).



**Flow**

> Emotions flow

Emotions *disrupt* the human body temporarily. After a burst of emotions (e.g. crying or laughing), the human body tends to return to a [balanced state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis). The two extreme deviations of this are an absense of emotions and a persistency of specific emotions. These signal an imbalance. Examples of long-term, persistent emotions are depression, hate and paranoia.
