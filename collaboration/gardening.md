# Gardening for Teams

The gardening approach leverages agency and diversity of the garden. It provides guard rails in which plants can grow. It addresses weed (bad habits) periodically.

## Context

This document considers (semi) self-managing teams. It assumes that:

-  Team members have some level of agency. They will make many decisions on their own.
- Team members are expected to work autonomously. They will adapt to uncertainty in the environment.

Typical difficulties in such environments are alignment, motivation and collaboration.

The subjects can be junior, senior or new team members.



## Principles

It can be difficult to find a the right balance between coaching, mentoring and delegating. Ideally there are clear expectations, motivational goals and engagement.



### TEAM

Inspired by the TEAM acronym from See *Hunt, Gather, Parent*.

|                          | **Intent**                                        | **Practice**                              |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Together**             | Participation over delegation                     | Pair up                                   |
| **Encourage**            | Inherent motivation                               | Incentives over rules                     |
| **Autonomy**             | Initiative of members                             | Discover what members want, but cannot do |
| **Minimal Interference** | Avoid micromanagement / spoon-feeding information | Provide room to struggle & learn          |

This does require proper guard rails. 

- The environment should be resilient enought to handle (small) mistakes.
- The environment should be [safe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_safety).



Cross-functional teams. Diversity in experience and specialziation. Similar to a [joint family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_joint_family), team members will learn from each other, coach each other and they will see others learn.



### Empiricism

Transparency, inspection and adaption. See [empiricism](../intelligence/empiricism.md).
