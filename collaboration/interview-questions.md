## Overview

Types of interviews

- Screening. Understand the candidate. Verify that the resume matches.
- Estimate capability: knowledge, skill or experience.



Screening rounds revolve around trust. Have a casual, bidirectional conversation. Notice verbal and non-verbal communication.

- Spot red flags early.
- Look for consistency. This may signal tension or uncertainty.
- Explore. Visit topics such as seniority, leadership or collaboration. 
  - Ask about relevant experience. E.g. a situation where the candidate had to deal with change, conflict or alignment.

Risks

- Under-emphasizing red flags after learning the candidateâ€™s strong points.

## Principles

> The interview should be a conversation rather than an exam.

Preparation & way of working

- Make notes and revisit them afterwards
- Prepare creative questions, personalized to the other party.
- Ask for references: both of the employee and the employer.

During interview/conversation

- Ask open questions (why, what, how,...).
- Don't fire-and-forget, instead pause (and elaborate) on each question.
- React to answers, come up with two counter-questions.

Intro. Expectation management.

- What do you want to talk about?
- What do expect?

Context

- Understand the other's motivation, passion, drives, desires.



### Practice

#### For Interviewers

- What are you looking for in this role?

Then come back to this occasionally.

#### For Interviewees

**Job interview**

Ask the interviewer at the beginning:

- What impact/results do you expect after a year?
- What is preventing you from reading this? What challenges are there?

Then tailor the rest of the conversation towards this.
