## Mindset

**Generic workflow**

> Visualize-Stabilize-Optimize. 

First find the right challenge (e.g. the bottleneck). Second, find stability, otherwise you cannot reliably control it. Finally, you can start to optimize.



**Daily workflow**

> Plan-Do-Check-Act

[PDCA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDCA). Plan and execute work. Check the result, and then reconsider improvements. *Act* relates to policital action. See [activity](../subjects/activity.md).



## Pull system

> Stop starting, start finishing

Kanban is a pull system. It puts an emphasis on finishing *work in progress* (WIP). It aims to finishing tasks before starting new tasks.

WIP limits are a balance:

- High limits give flexibility of picking up work. They increase the level of freedom: autonomy, flexibility.
- Low limits enforce focus and result in better cycle time.



## Anti-patterns

- No focus. Just produce a lot, fast.
- Silo's. Each member works in isolation. Lack of alignment.
- Tunnel vision. Bias for firefighting and short-term improvements. Not enough time to work on strategy.
