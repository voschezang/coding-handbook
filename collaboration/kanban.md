# Kanban

Kanban is a light-weight collaboration system designed to streamline production proceses. See [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban).



## Mindset

> Visualize-Stabilize-Optimize. 

First find the right challenge (e.g. the bottleneck). Second, find stability, otherwise you cannot reliably control it. Finally, you can start to optimize.

> Plan-Do-Check-Act

[PDCA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDCA). Plan and execute work. Check the result, and then reconsider improvements. *Act* relates to policital action. See [activity](../subjects/activity.md).



## Pull system

> Stop starting, start finishing

Kanban is a pull system. It puts an emphasis on finishing *work in progress* (WIP). It aims to finishing tasks before starting new tasks.



## Anti-patterns

- No focus. Just produce a lot, fast.
- Silo's. Each member works in isolation. Lack of alignment.
- Tunnel vision. Bias for firefighting and short-term improvements. Not enough time to work on strategy.
