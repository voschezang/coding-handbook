# Leadership

Leadership is the ability to connect, in the context of an organization. Communication [styles](communication-styles.md) play a huge role, whether in-person or [textual](documentation.md).



## Types

Two extreme leadership styles are authoritative and surrendered leadership.

- The former finds strength in power and control. It values conformity.
- The latter finds strength in courage and empowerment. It values diversity (difference).

|                 | **Authoritative**                   | Surrendered                            |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Core**        | Power                               | Empowerment (trust)                    |
| **Style**       | Be in control                       | Minimal interference, welcome autonomy |
| **Behaviour**   | Control, command, challenge         | Encourage, incentivize, facilitate     |
| **Personality** | Assertive, confident, goal-oriented | Authentic, courage                     |
| **Environment** | Competitive                         | Collaborative                          |



Minimal inteference. See [gardening](gardening.md).

- Guard rails make it easier to trust people to act autonomously.
- Acceptance of the present. Not trying to fix everything or coach everyone.



Other types are transformational and transactional leadership

- Transformational leadership is about inspiration and growth. Mentor others and belief in change.
- Transactional leadership is about performance. Focus on targets and reward good behaviour.
- Servant leadership is about inclusion and engagement. Coaching and support others.

Decision making can be autocratic or democratic.
