# Leadership

Leadership is the ability to connect, in the context of an organization. Communication [styles](communication-styles.md) play a huge role, whether in-person or [textual](documentation.md).

## Context

> Good leadership is situational

Leadership can be optimized for an environment. Its affected by the leader, the followers, the [environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynefin_framework) and the objective.

- In a *simple* environment, follow best practices. Execution of work involves following pre-determined steps.

- In a *complex* environment, develop your own practice. Execution of work involves adaption and autonomy.

Leadership may be problem-oriented or opportunity-oriented. See [proposals](proposals.md).



**Anti-pattern**

- Broadcasting without connection. Sharing a message, without appreciating how it is received.



## Dual Model

Two extremes in leadership styles are authoritative and surrendered leadership.

- The former finds strength in power. It optimizes for control. It values conformity. 
- The latter finds strength in courage and empowerment. It optimizes for autonomy. It values diversity (difference).



The leadership style

|                  | Authoritative Leadership       | Surrendered Leadership              |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| **Core**         | Power                          | Empowerment (trust)                 |
| **Method**       | Give orders. Control. Enforce. | Set expectations. Welcome autonomy. |
| **Bias**         | Goal-oriented.                 | Relation-oriented.                  |
| **Attitude**     | Rational. Risk-averse.         | Optimistic. Hopeful.                |
| **Environments** | Competitive or structured      | Collaborative and safe              |
| **Desire**       | Survival, performance          | Harmony, connection, growth         |

The leader

|                   | Authoritative Leader             | Surrendered Leader                  |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Personality**   | Assertive, confident, determined | Authentic, brave, warm              |
| **Risk**          | Aggressive, ruthless, cold       | Sub-assertive, soft                 |
| **Communication** | Control, command, challenge.     | Encourage, incentivize, facilitate. |



Minimal inteference. See [gardening](gardening.md).

- Guard rails make it easier to trust people to act autonomously.
- Acceptance of the present. Not trying to fix everything or coach everyone.



Other types are transformational and transactional leadership

- Transformational leadership is about inspiration and growth. Mentor others and belief in change.
- Transactional leadership is about performance. Focus on targets and reward good behaviour.
- Servant leadership is about inclusion and engagement. Coaching and support others.



## Trinity Model

|               | Aggressor | Saviour            | Visionary   |
| ------------- | --------- | ------------------ | ----------- |
| **Emphasis**  | Power     | Emphasise problems | Opportunity |
| **Followers** | Fear      | Trust              | Hope        |



## Decision making

Decision making can be autocratic or democratic.



## Inclusion

Inclusion

- Include (encourage) other participants. 
  - Pivot. what do you think? How does that sound to you? Do you agree?
