# Meeting Templates

These are written for self-managing teams. The underlying purpose is to be a great team and to achieve results.

## Lookahead



### User Story Mapping

```markdown
# ⭐ Purpose
Develop a shared understanding of _subject_.

# 🚀 Outcome
Record the story-chain: the goal and the path towards it.

# 📅 Agenda
(First part)
- Where are we now?
- Where do we go?
- What steps are in between? What else?
(Second part)
- What will we need first?

# 📖 Pre-read / preparation
Any background on the topic.
```

 

### Refinement

*E.g. of user stories.*

```markdown
# ⭐ Purpose
Develop a shared understanding about initiatives.

# 🚀 Outcome
For each user story
- Decide acceptance criteria. _"How we know the story is done"_
- A conversation about the plan.
- A vote of confidence on the complexity (likelihood)

# 📅 Agenda
For each user story:
- Present the goal and a plan to reach it. 
- Discuss expecations and risks.
- Estimate the complexity / effort
```



## Lookback



### Retrospective

```markdown
# ⭐ Purpose
Take a moment to stand still. Reconsider what we are doing.

# 🚀 Outcome
Shared understanding of ...
(Either)
- Reflect on past experience. Daily operations, team dynamics, collaboration.
- Reflect on past weeks in relation to pre-defined objectives.

# 📅 Agenda
- What's on your mind / what do you see / how do you feel?
- What was it like for you?
- How does the current state relate to our target conditions?

# 📖 Pre-read / preparation
(if applicable)
- Consider the current targets on the roadmap.
- Consider the team objectives.
```



### Project / Roadmap Progress

This template focusses on **expectation** management. It's about taking a step back and *acknowledging* where you are. Activate each other when necessary.

- This is not a *planning* session. It does not aim to optimize timelines. If a handful of projects needs to be adjusted then that can be done after the meeting.
- This is not a *justification* session. Don't use it to attribute problems or find blame.
- The session may result in action points. E.g. an in-depth session on specific initiatives.

```markdown
# ⭐ Purpose
Shared understanding of the quarterly plan. Reduce ambiguity.

# 🚀 Outcome
For developers:
- Awareness of each topic (e.g. epics).
- Awareness of parts that need adjustment.

For stakeholders:
- Transparancy. More accurate expectations.

# 📅 Agenda
For each topic
- Where are we w.r.t. the goal? E.g. what deliverable.
- What do we expect?

# 📖 Pre-read / preparation
- The order (priority) of projects in this quarter.
- The goals of the projects that are _in progress_.
```

**Anti-pattern**

- Interrogation without offering help. No collaboration (*together*).
- Responding with critique (blame) after openness. Rather than welcoming honesty.
