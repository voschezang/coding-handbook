> Meeting is just a euphemism for "unproductive collaboration".

## Overview

The **style** can be:

- `Disrupt-resolve`. Question the current state.
- `Accept-inspire`. Stand still, accept the present state. Then look for opportunities.



The **method** can vary from a presentation to a workshop.

- Standard meeting. Planning, decision making and alignment.
  - Make a decision and get everyone on board. Coordinate plans.
  - Check-in. Align. Sometimes regularly, e.g. daily, weekly, monthly.
- Workshop. Do actual work, together in the same time and place.
- Lecture. Broadcast information.



### Style

Ordinary meetings become part of business as usual.

Occasionally there is a need to be *dynamic*. Addressing conflict is vital for an engaged discussion. Two approaches are to lead with either challenge or inspiration. See [proposals](proposals.md).

These approaches question:

- Question the present. Question observed thought or behaviour patterns.
- Question possibilities. Given an idealistic desire, question the obstacles.

|                | Challenge               | Inspire                   |
| -------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Style**      | Problem-oriented        | Opportunity-oriented      |
| **Flow**       | Challenge, then resolve | Accept, then inspire      |
| **Conflict**   | Question the present.   | Question future obstacles |
| **Engagement** | Based on fear           | Relate to shared desire   |



### Personal Meeting Types

### Work Meeting Types

The main purpose of a meeting can be goal-oriented or relation-oriented.

#### Production-oriented

This follows the cycle of work items: `plan-do-check-act`. Accountability is built in, through a focus on results.

| Type         | Core             | Examples                          |
| ------------ | ---------------- | --------------------------------- |
| 🗺️ Look back  | Where are we?    | Retrospective, risk storming      |
| 🧭 Look ahead | Where do we go?  | Quarterly planning, story mapping |
| ⚙️ Production | Achieve results. | Workshop                          |

#### Relation-oriented

| Type                       | Core                  |
| -------------------------- | --------------------- |
| 💡 Inspiration / motivation | Share a vision.       |
| ⭐ Alignment                | Share a target.       |
| ❤️ Connect / appreciate     | Strengthen relations. |

#### Control-oriented

| Type           | Core                      |
| -------------- | ------------------------- |
| ❔ Interview.   | Understand a subject.     |
| ❓Challenge     | Question a subject.       |
| ☑️ Status check | Comply to a model (rules) |



**Anti-patterns**

- Fake accountability. Use check-in meeting to receive status updates, without commitment or clear outcomes. If there was real accountability, the stakeholders would've already been updated.
- Knowledge sharing without alignment with organizational strategy.
- No agenda. Keep discussing new topics, rather than following up on previous topics.
  - *"How is it going with ...?"*. 




## Preparation

Tools to improve meetings. See [meeting templates](meeting-templates.md).

- Share a public agenda beforehand. Let participants decide how to prepare and whether to join.
- Read-in introduction. To be read together. Ensure shared understanding.
- Opening / ice-breaker. Set expectations and explain the scope.
- Chair or facilator role. Assign someone to keep track of things.
- Minutes of meeting (MoM). Publish meeting notes.
- Explicit expectations on purpose and outcomes.



## Goals

Generic goals. Ranging from content-oriented to relation-oriented.

- Discover the range of relevant **options** for a decision or problem.
- Explore a subject and **determine** the right approach - while involving the group.
- Improve the **relationship** of the group. Make everyone feel valued. Improve the group dynamics.

Specific goals (focus)

- Make a **decision** and get everyone on board. E.g. stakeholders or colleagues.
- Share information.
  - Convey a key **message** clearly and memorably.
  - Invoke an **emotion**. E.g. inspiration, trust, pride, courage, empathy.
- Provide feedback. Reflect.
  - **Align** on definition of success.
  - **Represent** the current state and recent changes.
  - Explore up risks and open questions.
  - Define next steps.
- Strengthen **relationships**.
  - Gain better understanding and improve trust.
  - Culture of openness and being authentic.
- Brainstorming. Think out of the box. Come up with novel insights.

> Lack of conflict is an indicator that the right topics aren't being addressed.

Signs of good meetings

  - Key participants take time to do preparation and post-preparation.
  - Expectations have been set at the beginning of the meeting.
  - There is either a good structure or a good agenda.
  - The scope is specific and appropriate.
  - Out-of-scope topics are saved for later. Action points are written down.
  - A decision is made at the end.

- Diversity / interaction

  - The chair makes decisions, despite absence of consensus.
