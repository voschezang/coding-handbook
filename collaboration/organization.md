## Identity

 An organization may define itself on different levels. Based on Bateson's pyramid.

1. Meaning. Awareness of identity. What should our identity be?
2. Identity. Who are we?
3. Values. Give this identity, what do we value?
4. Beliefs. How do these values relate to the real world.
5. Capability. What are we capable of doing?
6. Behavior. What are we doing?
7. Environment. What is outside of us?

Identity influences decisions. For example, belief is a prerequisite for making changes - and it can limit capability. 

E.g.

```markdown
**We      can    do         this     here**
_identity belief capability behavior environment_
```
