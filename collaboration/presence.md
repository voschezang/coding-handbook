# Presence

Connection requires presence. Connection occurs socially and personally - between the mind and body.

- There are many environments when this is infeasible. It requires peace and safety.



## Overview

To be present is to:

- Slow down. Stay in the moment. *Don't rush, don't avoid.*
- Pay attention to the present moment. *Don't don't recall, don't worry, don't hope, don't imagine.*
- Feel your feelings. Empathize. Notice sensations without understanding them.



## Sharing experience

The experience of a person in the present moment. From surface-level to to deep, personal information. See [experience](../psychology/experience.md).

- **Surrounding**. *Where are you?*
- **Activity** *What are you doing? What are you not doing?*
- **Attention** *Where is your attention?*
  - *What's on your mind? What do (don't) you feel? What do (don't) you see?*
  - *What do you notice? What is absent?*
- **Attraction** *What is attracting your attention?* E.g. curiousity, sensuality, love.
- **Desire** *What would you like? What do you need?*
- **Identity** *Who are you?*



These questions have an **interview** format. In real conversations, people tend to alternate communication styles. For example:

- Non-verbal signals. E.g. nodding.
- Sharing observations. *"I noticed that ..."*
- Disclosing liking. *"That makes me feel..."*
- Repetition. Emphasizing certain words, or summarizing content.
- Suggestions. *"We could explore ..."*



These questions are phrased with minimal **judgement**. Judging experience takes you out of the present.

- When discussed openly, without judement, these topics tend to create a sense of connection.

- When avoided or lying, these topics create disconnect.
