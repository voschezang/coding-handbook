## Call To Action

Proposals can emphasise the upside or downside. They can be opportunity-oriented or problem-oriented. The former inspires, while the other may invoke fear or anger.

- Opportunity: "Our strength is X, let's use it to achieve Y" 
- Problem: "Z might cause huge problems. We need to do Y."

Effects

- Fear may make people more conservative.
- Losing something tends to be overvalued in comparison to gaining something. E.g. losing all of your wealth is a greater change than doubling your wealth.
