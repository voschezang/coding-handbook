# Proposals

[toc]

## Overview

There are three phases: `relation-question-answer`

1. Set context. Connect to the audience. Involve them. *Why is this relevant to you, now?*
2. Align on the need for change. Question the current state. A problem or opportunity. See *call to action*.
3. Align on the next step. Consider solutions (answers). A path forward. See [story-mapping](../labour/story-mapping.md).



**Anti-patterns**

- Delegating the problem. *X is a problem, so you need to change."*
- Bias for a fixed solution.



## Call To Action

Proposals can emphasise the upside or downside. They can be opportunity-oriented or problem-oriented. The former inspires, while the other may invoke fear or anger.

- Opportunity: "Our strength is X, let's use it to achieve Y" 
- Problem: "Z might cause huge problems. We need to do Y."

Effects

- Fear may make people more conservative.
- Losing something tends to be overvalued in comparison to gaining something. E.g. losing all of your wealth is a greater change than doubling your wealth.
