## Overview

Principles

- Use a warmup exercise to set the mood. Manage expectations.
- Use multiple time-boxed exercises to stimulate a good balance of going wide and going deep.
  - Bring attention back to the group in each next section.
- Switch between individual and group conversations.
  - "How do you see this?"
  - "Does anyone recognize this?"
- Follow-up on interesting answers.
- Reserve a brief moment at the end to reflect on the session itself.
  - "What are your takeaways?"



Focus on flow, rather than control

- Loop over the group after each iteration
- Lots of degrees of freedom in between

Focus on the value chain.

Verify

- Is there uncertainty or risk involved in specific segments?

- Ease. How can we make it easy to do? 
- Reminder. How will we remember to do this? 
```



## Brainstorming / Sense making

### Sailboat

Imagine sailing across the ocean.

```markdown
- üí® What our wind? What pushes us forward?
- ‚òÄÔ∏è What's our sun? What gives us energy?
- üéØ What's our goal? In what direction are we moving?
- ‚öì What our anchor? What keeps us in place?
- ü™∏ What are the reefs? What risks are out there?
```

<img src="../img/sailboat.png" alt="sailboat" style="width:50%;" />

### Air Balloon

Imagine flying in a hot air balloon. Together you're trying to go somewhere.

```markdown
We're flying towards `[..]`.
- ‚ô®Ô∏è Hot air. What is lifting us up? What is giving us success?
- ‚öì Rope, weights. What is keeping us down? What is difficult?
- üå®Ô∏è Weather storms. What risks do you see?
- üå§Ô∏è Sun. What do you appreciate?
```



### Train Station

Image that you're on a train station. Your train is delayed. [src](https://retromat.org/en/?id=127)

```markdown
- Destination. Where is your train going?
- Delay. How much delay is there? What contributed to this?
- Announcement. What is the announced reason for the delay?
```



### Map: focus and collaboration

Let each team member denote where they are on a map. Use arrows to show where they want to move to.

<img src="../img/map-focus-collaboration.png" alt="map-focus-collaboration" style="width:80%;" />

### Crazy Idea

Compile a list of ideas:

```markdown
- What would be a crazy idea?
```

Then reclect each item. What would be the benefits? How else could we achieve those?



### Worst case scenario

Compile a list of ideas:

```markdown
- What would turn the next week/month into a disaster?
- If we 
```

Then flip each item. What would be the opposite of this?



### 3 Qualities

Inspired by [Jnana yoga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jnana_yoga).

```markdown
- Drive. What gives you motivation and energy?
- Discernment. Detachement.
	- ‚ù§Ô∏è What do you *like*? What do you want to do now?
	- ‚ôªÔ∏è What is *good* for you? What would you have wanted to do a year from now?
- Dispassion. How easy is it to defer or delay work?
  *"Focus means saying no"*
```



### RCA: 5x Why

> There is never one problem.

> People are never impediments, but roles can be.

Root cause analysis (RCA). Get to the root of a problem.

Asking `why` can be confronting. To invite openness, make it smaller.

- Make it specific.
- Make it abstract. *"What could we do in the future?"*

```markdown
# Given a problem or event.
- Start positive. What went well?
- Why did this happen?
  - And why did that happen?
    - And why?
      - And why?
        - And why?
```
