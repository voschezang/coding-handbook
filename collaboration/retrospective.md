- Switch between individual and group conversations.
    - "How do you see this?"
    - "Does anyone recognize this?"

- Reserve a brief moment at the end to reflect on the session itself.
    - "What are your takeaways?"

**Roles**

- Leader / interviewer - rotating dialogues with each participant

Focus on flow, rather than control

- loop over the group after each iteration
- Lots of degrees of freedom in between
