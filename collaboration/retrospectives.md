# Retrospectives

A retrospective is a reflection (lookback) session with the aim of learning.

## Overview

A team cannot function without *healthy* dynamics. Even predictable environment are surrounded by complex dynamics between people.

Retrospectives help teams to improve. It addresses systematic issues and it improve connection (inclusivity) of the team. Moreover, doing retrospectives *regularly* influences the culture and expectations of team members. Good intentions will become habbits.

The style of retrospectives tends to change as the team matures and grows. A facilitator may give the following explanation.

```
1. The initial focus is connection with each other. Once weâ€™ve developed more trust, I will initiate debate around important issues. 
2. This will gradually lead to commitments. I'll help you to inspect these and make them more transparent. Commitments invite accountability - which can lead to confrontations. 
3. In turn, we'll learn how to make this easier. Finally, we'll shift our attention to results.
```

Note that result-oriented sessions can be perceived as more usefull, in a business sense. However, this requires a level of psychological safety - which is why the earlier steps are important.



### Sessions

Specific sessions can be adapted to the preferences of the team. Good facilitation considers the need of team members to be heard.

Sessions can include two phases.

1. Connection. Connect to each other, as a team. Be [present](presence.md) with each other.
2. Reflect on a topic. E.g. team goals or recent events.

This does require a [safe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_safety) environment, where people are willing to address conflict.



## Benefits

The benefit of retrospectives is twofold. In the *short* term it provides awareness. In the *long* term it improves effectiveness and team health. It does so by refecting back on the past weeks. In addition, it facilitates a discussion about expectations and progress.

## Subjects

The subject of the session can be either:

- the team vison and/or team goals.
- the team itself: its members and their dynamics.
- the work of the team. E.g. epics.
- (speed of) decision making and commitments. Expectations.



## Method

**Roles**

- Leader / interviewer - rotating dialogues with each participant
- Facilitating manager - steer from a distance, subtly



**Persona's**

- New team members. They haven't yet shown major contributions, but they have a beginner's mind and drive to improve.
- Old guard. They have seen it all and accept the status quo. They may be reluctant to innovate.
- The team as a whole. Their goals may be in line with goals of individual team members.



## Practice

Retrospectives give the greatest benefit when they become a common practice. This requires a balance:

- Enough repetition to make the sessions go fluently.
- Enough diversity to make the sessions worthwhile.
- Engagement of all participants.
- Focus on specific topics.
