# Performance of Team Members

Performance evaluations are standard in many organizations. Usually they are done by a manager.



Approaches

- Focus on performance. *What did they achieve? In what ways did they contribute?*
- Focus on potential. *What is their capability?*

The former may be followed up by a improvement plan. *What is impeding performance?*

The latter considers knowledge, skill, experience and personality. It emphasises future value over success in the past environment.



**Anti-patterns**

- Focus on evaluation and control, rather than working actively to improve performance.



## Performance models

The following perspectives provide questions that can be discussed. Ideally the answers are used as input for planning sessions. See [team performance](team-performance.md) and [team success](team-success.md).



### Team-based Perspective

This focusses on the question: *Does the subject fit well in the team?*

Trust

- *Is the subject **trustworthy**? Is there toxic behaviour?*

Team dynamics

- *Does the subject **contribute** to the team (product)?*
- *Is the **quality** of contribution high?*
- *Does subject able to communicate and **collaborate** properly?*

Care for team vision

- *Does the subject **engage** actively, in line with the team vision?*
- *Does the subject engage in **improvement**?*
