# Team Performance

A team is a set of players that work together to achieve a shared goal. Their performance is the ability to make progress towards this goal. This may involves adaption and innovation. Comparing the performance of different teams is difficult. It is a mix of value delivery, productivity and capability. See [teams](teams.md) and [team success](team-success.md).

## Overview

Team performance focusses on production: planning and execution. It makes uses of capabilities to deliver a service to a customer that benefits from it. For businesses this results in profit. The latter is dependent on many external factors. See [product management](product-management.md).

Striclty speaking, **performance** is captured by productivity and the quality of the product. Capability can be measured by *agility*: the speed at which the organization can realize new ideas and deliver results. It consists of organizational capability and technical capability.

- Team **succes** can be defined as a mix of performance and team health (satisfaction).

> Performance is not about metrics.

While it is useful to find metrics that correlate with succes, metrics are never the goal.



### Roles

There are two main accountabilities: the value chain and the production chain. These focus on  delivering value and production quality, respectively.

<img src="../img/value-chain-production-chain.png" alt="value-chain-production-chain" style="height:15em;" />

The following roles provide **accountability**:

- Product manager. *Build the right thing.* *What is produced.*
- Engineers. *Build it right.* *How it is produced*



In addition, there are many **activities** that create value. 

- Creation. E.g. design, development.
- Enabling. E.g. coaching, removing impediments.



### Value Delivery

>  Deliver value ‚â† solving problems

Delivery is contingent on a good view of what would be valuable. Product delivery is preceded by product *discovery*. See [results](../labour/realization.md) and [goals](../subject/goal.md).

In general, a team aims to deliver *value* to stakeholders. The definition of value is context-dependent. There can be an emphasis on current or potential value. The latter consists of growth and unrelalized value. See [realization](../labour/realization.md).

<img src="../img/growth-and-value.png" alt="growth-and-value" style="height:16em;" />

Theoretically value can grow indefinitely. In practice growth accelerates and then slows down.



## Cost of Succes

> Performance is not about metrics.

While it is useful to find metrics that correlate with succes, metrics are never the goal.



Succes has several risks. It is not guaranteed to be sustainable. 

- The nature of these risks can be either long-term consequences or immediate side-effects.

- It can result in increased stress, competition and stagnation.



### Risks

**Immediate issues**, as side-effect of succeeding.

- Effects on employees
  - Alienation due to standardization and scale. Less personal involvement and care.
  - More responsibility due to the organization depending on the product.
  - More responsibility due to customers depending on the product.
  - Declining collaboration, due to increased competition of team members..
- Technical problems
  - Security and compliance issues after changing too rapidly.



Limited **sustainability**. Lower agility, higher operating cost.

- Business agility

  - Decreased profitability after attracting competitors.
  - Inability to adapt to market changes, after over-indexing on a specific solution.
  - Becoming extremely conserative and risk-averse, after reaching a local optimum.

- Mismatch in capability

  - Higher expectations of the team from management.
  - Higher expectations of the product from customers.

  - Technical debt after prioritizing short term performance over long term performance.
  - Higher complexity. Higher maintenance cost.



## Improvement

> Team performance converges

Team performance tends to flow. It can be brought up to a stable average. Afterwards it will naturally go up and down over time. It is is influenced by many external factors.

This inherent instability is what makes it important to strive for continuous improvement. From reacting to change to acting pro-actively.

Note that good metrics depends on the context. Metrics such as output (volume), resource utilization and number of incidents are considered anti-patterns.

Typical phases of each factor.

- Value delivery evolves form producing something to producing something valuable, consistently, in line with organizaitonal strategy.
- Value production evolves from firefighting to strategic production. Move from firefighting hats to cowboy hats to engineering hats.
- Organizational capability evolves from reacting to change to pro-actively adapting.

Organizational capability is closely related to team maturity. They emphasise different sides of collaboration and resilience.



Any two dimensions can be visualized in a map.

## Capability

Capability is the ability to innovate. The speed at change can be implemented.



Capability consists of organizational capability and technological capability.

- Organizational capability considers the individual team and the organization that it is a part of. This includes team maturity and agility. It may cover the dynamics between team members, their development and thier satisfaction.
- Technological capability increases by finishing increments of work. Growth is limited by maintainability and operating cost.
- Organizational capability is the result of social dynamics. It can be increased by streamlining, restructuring or expanding the organization



Social dynamics

Factors

- Team members and their dynamics. Team member satisfaction, team maturity.
- Underlying factors: culture, principles, process
