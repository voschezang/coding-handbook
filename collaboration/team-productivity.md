# Team Productivity

This is a model for team productivity. It provides insight into dynamics such as stabilization and innovation. See also team [productivity](team-productivity.md) and [success](team-success.md).

## Introduction

Teams tend to evolve naturally through periods of instability and growth. Both productivity and value delivery fluctuate throughout these periods. The progression of productivity can be modelled as an evolution through distinct challenges, which are followed by shifts in priorities and productivity.

The following phases characterize a challenge in the team's evolution.

1. üî• **Firefighing**. Sprinting towards immediate results. Activities are split between resolving incidents and training new hires. The backlog keeps growing.
2. ‚öñÔ∏è **Focus**. WIP is limitted to improve lead time and consistency. Work is shared more effectively in the team. Impediments are resolved earlier.
3. ‚öôÔ∏è **Flow**. The team is stabilizing and cycle time is improving. The team *just* needs time to pay off technical debt.
4. üöÄ **Innovation**. There is room work strategically. The balance between operations and changes shifts.

The phases are instable. Solving a challenge allows a transition to a new phase.



The initial optimization is about balancing the challenge in the current phase with the eventual transition to a new phase. Surprisingly, the innovation phase tends to leads back to a previous phase.

## Unsustainable Productivity

The harder a team pushes towards the last phase, the greater the resistance it will encounter. The innovation phase is especially unpredictable, due to its side-effects:

- Natural entropy caused by new tooling, processes or scale. Need to maintain the newly developed tooling.
- Organizational pressure to focus on lower-performing teams. Team members being be re-allocated.
- Performance being penalized by higher expectations or workload. 
- External changes that disrupt the team.
- Experimentation being seen as a opportunity to cut costs.

This provides two paths forward.

- Focus on innovation and growth. Plan to evolve the team after a limited period of innovation - and continue with phase 1.

- Be conservative and spend a minority of effort on innovation. Attempt to keep a balance between operations and innovation.

## Long-term Productivity

The instable phases result to a characteristic pattern, not unlike to boom and bust cycles in economics. Over-optimizing for growth and innovation will fail eventually, and result in a period of underperformance.

Another analogy is that of (simulated) [annealing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing). This optimization technique alternates stabilization (exploitation) with diversification (exploration). Local optimization is alternated with diversification to improve the global state.
