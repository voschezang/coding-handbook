# Team Success

Being a *great* team is much more involved than being productive.

## Overview

This model consists of three layers.

1. Trust. Towards each other. This relates to appreciation and safety.
2. Team dynamics. Participation of team members, their collaboration and (open) communication.
3. Care for the team vision. Engagement and shared interests.

### Visibility

> Succes is in the past.

Past succes can be measurable. Succes in the current moment is merely a prediction (estimation).



Signals found in successful teams.

- **Vibe**. There is a pleasant vibe in the team. You can feel that the team is happy. Usually this requires physiological safety.
- **Conflict** is acknowledged and addressed. Discussions include engagement and disagreement.
- **Progress** is frequent. Results are celebrated.
- The **vision** of the team and organization are clear. Team activities are aligned.
- **Resilience**. The team is able to deal with setbacks.



## Context

### Team Structure

- What are the roles in the team? How much overlap is there?
- What is the size of the team and the organization?
- How much diversity is there in the team (e.g. juniors and seniors)?

See [joint teams](joint-teams.md).



### Team Lifecycle

Another factor is the lifecycle of the team. Changes within the team and of the position of the team in an organization.



### Team Autonomy

Team dynamics are highly influenced by the autonomy and maturity of the team.

Team culture

- How does shared responsibility compare to individual responsibilities?
- How are team members rewarded?

Other factors

- What are the power structures?
- Does the team manage their own budget?
- What is the accountability of the team?
- What is the level of competition in the team (and the organization)?



### Team Culture

**Communication**

- Format: textual - verbal
- Clustering: pairing - group meetings
- Interaction: with nearby teams - with other departments
- Awareness of each other's work
- Consistency of performance



**Purpose**

- Internal incentives (e.g. passion) or external incentives (e.g. compensation).
- Focus on individual performance or team performance.
- Idealistic or pragmatic (e.g. commercial) goals.



**Operation**

- Ratio between BAU or change.
- Ratio between unplanned or planned work.
- Amount of standardization and experimentation.



**Reflection**

- Frequency of reflection.
- Importance of commitments.
- Ambition of commitments: optimistic or realistic.
- Accountability of commitments.
