### Discovery

1. Look & **feel**. Use intuition.
2. **Listen** to customers, stakeholders and employees.
3. Monitor effectiveness, predictability and efficiency.



**Red flags**

- Is there trust?
- Is there a shared goal?
- Is there miscommunication?
- Are risks transparent?



### Properties of a successful team

The strongest signal is when you can feel that the team is happy or productive. Note that a team can function well, despite a difficult environment. Some major signals are:

1. **Vibe**. There is a pleasant vibe in the team. You can feel that the team is happy. Usually this requires physiological safety.
2. **Expectations**. There is *transparency* on expectations. This includes expectations from stakeholders and from team members themselves.
3. **Team results**. There is *transparency* and reflection on on team results. They are compared to original goals.
4. **Resilience**. The team is able to deal with setbacks.

In addition, there are more fine grained signals:

- Individual team members are content within their team and with each other. The team works in harmony.
- There is transparency w.r.t. work, roles and responsibility.
- Conflict is addressed openly.
- The team takes ownership of short- and long-term goals.
- There is accountability of results.
- Stakeholders trust the team.
- Team members find purpose or meaning in their work.



**Maturity** of autonomous teams. This shows where improvement will yield the best results. [Read more](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/MaturityModel.html).

1. Able to survive. Focus on fire-fighting.
2. In control of daily operations.
3. Able to commit to short-term plans.
4. Able to plan and execute, in line the organizational objectives, together with other teams.



### Anti-patterns

1. A lack of vision results in unclear and diverging goals.
2. Poor incentives promote resource utilization, which results in local optimization.
3. Unclear goals contribute further to a bias resource utilization. This emphasizes (individual) productivity over long-term outcomes.
4. These dynamics make it difficult to make commitments and hold the team accountable.
5. As a result, progress is hampered.

### Optimizing Performance

Performance evaluation / reflection / planning for autonomous teams

Note: not a replacement for one-on-one performance evaluations with a manager

Attitude

- Growth mindset, learn how to help each other
- Team performance > individual performance



Phases

- Discovery
    - What can we expect? / Where are we now?
    - Objectives. What should we expect? What do we want to achieve in the next quarter?
    - Results. Which results will show that we've reached these objectives?
    - What are the obstacles?
- Delivery
    - Develop a plan to reach these results.
        - E.g. how do we distribute work
    - And/or how to do this in the future.



### Health Indicators

Perspectives

- Breakdown by activity: making plans, following plans and adapting plans.

- Breakdown by context: team view, functional view, strategic view.



For a typical software development team, this could result in the following metrics. See also the [Spotify health model](https://engineering.atspotify.com/2014/09/squad-health-check-model/).

|                     | Quality                  | Resilience                                   |
| ------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Human view**      | Team dynamics and health | Ability to deal with setbacks.               |
| **Functional view** | Daily operation          | Ability to deal with disruption.             |
| **Strategic view**  | Ability to plan ahead    | Ability to adapt. Consistency over time      |
| **Execution view**  | Quality of projects      | Predictability. E.g. lead time of increments |

The following table depicts a visual interpretation.

- Similar columns are placed next to each other to highlight possible correlation.
- The column *expected* is filled in optimistically.

| Perspective         | Metric                       | Expected                              | Currently                                | Recently                                 | Historically                             |

| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Mission**                 | We know where we're heading.          | We have many priorities.           |
| **Unplanned operations**    | We are able to deal with disruptions. | We are constantly disrupted.       |
| **Planned operations**      | We feel in control.                   | We are always short of resources.  |

#### Models

Models that provide insight and can be used to predict effectiveness.



Lencioni model (five dysfunctions of a team)

1. Absence of **trust**. Can team members be open/vulnerable?
2. Fear of **conflict**. Is conflict suppressed?
3. Lack of **commitment**. Dedication.
4. Avoidance of **accountability**. Do team members hold each other accountable?
5. Inattention to - collective - **results**. Versus local/personal results.



Google model. [src](https://rework.withgoogle.com/blog/five-keys-to-a-successful-google-team/)

1. **Psychological safety** – Feeling able to take risks without feeling insecure or embarrassed.
2. **Dependability** – Being able to count on each other to deliver high-quality work on time.
3. **Structure & clarity** – Having clear goals, roles, and plans for each member and the group as a whole.
4. **Meaning of work** – Working on something personally important to each team member.
5. **Impact of work** – The belief that the work being done matters.
