# Human Communication

These models are valid for specific circumstances. E.g. professional communication within a corporate setting. They are useful for collaborative interaction and trustworthy relations. See also [requirements engineering](management/requirements-engineering.md) and [documentation](documentation.md).

[toc]

General principles

- "**Right**" communication depends on the listener, the environment and your history.
- There is **always** communication. Even being absent or silent sends a message.
- Human communication is extremely **noisy** and inefficient.

## Why: Attitude & Relation

**Attitude**

To make communication more effective.

- **Optimism** and trust is more productive (for collaboration) than pessimism and distrust.
  - Most behaviour can be explained by positive intent and [bounded rationality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounded_rationality)

- Make reversible decisions *eagerly* and irreversible decisions *conservatively*.
- **Lazy** evaluations. Collect information before stopping at a decision.
  - Lead with Why, rather than How.
  - Align and decide on the problem, then the solution, and only then the implementation.
  - Allow the other to change their position.
- Embrace **uncertainty** and sensitivity.
  - Assume that there are multiple unknowns.
  - Address ambiguity and uncertainty. Call it out.
  - Acknowledge emotions and make them explicit, rather than suppressing them.

**Context: Relation**

Which role you are expected to take. This is determined by your history and the start of the interaction.

- Leader. Steering, setting examples and standards. Being responsible.
- Facilitator.
- Mediator, negotiator.
- Coach, mentor.
- Teacher.
- Expert. Advising. Give an objective opinion.
- Manager. Asking questions, deciding

## How: Behaviour

Models

- Communication triangle
- Inside, outside, other side
- Four-sided of message model

Patterns

- Forms / channels of communication
- Attitude: sub-assertive, assertive, aggressive
- Bridging - mediating - negotiating
- Collaborative - competitive

### Models

#### Communication Triangle

Move naturally between corners for a good, balanced conversation flow. Avoid dwelling too long on a single aspect.

#### Subjectivity: In/Out/Other-side

> "Good" communiction depends on all three components

Miscommunication is often caused by mistranslations.

Components

- Inside. E.g. beliefs, emotions, thoughts, physical sensation.
- Outside. Content, voice, body language.
- Other-side. Any filters/biases of the other.

Relation

- Transparency: from inside to outside.
- Feedback: from other to outside.

#### Four-sides Model

Messages send from a sender to a receiver consist of [four aspects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-sides_model):

- Factual aspect
- Relational aspect
- Self-revealing or self-disclosing aspect
- Appeal. A wish or want.

Aligning these aspects keeps the message pure and avoids miscommunication. Mixed messages may be interpreted in an unexpected way. See [meta-communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta-communication).

### Patterns

#### Forms of communication

Channels

- **Email**. Ideals for broadcasts (one-to-many). Suitable for one-directional communication such as status updates. Useful as a conversation starter, rather than a one-directional channel.
- **Phone** call. Ideal for quick feedback.
- **Meeting**. Multi-purpose. E.g. explore options, improve group relationships, determine the right approach. See [management-principles](management/management-principles.md)
- **In-person** meeting. Emphasis on attitude and off-topic subjects.

Specific forms

- **Absence** of silence. This may send a mixed messages. It may be interpreted in many different ways.
- **Presence** and attention. E.g. to show support.

#### Communication styles

- Ideal behaviour: switch between these based on context and need.

| Pushing                                            | Pulling                                                  |
| -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Taking space                                       | Giving space                                             |
| Goal/content-oriented                              | Relation-oriented                                        |
| Persuading, asserting, incentivizing (sanctioning) | Bridging (involving, listening, disclosing), attracting. |

#### Level of assertiveness

- Ideal behaviour: find a balance based on each other's boundaries.

| Sub-assertive       | Assertive              | Aggressive            |
| ------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------- |
| Indirect            | Direct + respect       | Direct - respect      |
| Relation > goal     | Relation + goal        | Goal > relation       |
| Lowering boundaries | Maintaining boundaries | Going over boundaries |
| Too agreeable       |                        | Too defensive         |

#### Mediation & Negotiation

The difference between these can be a matter of framing.

- Ideal behaviour: depends on the role: from collaborating to competing.
- Find a fair deal. Mutual gain, objective criteria.

| Bridging           | Mediation            | Negotiation         |
| ------------------ | -------------------- | ------------------- |
| Learn and relate   | Mutual gain. Win-win | Zero-sum game       |
| Explore needs      | Shared goal.         | Individual goals    |
| Emphasize relation | Emphasize interests  | Emphasize positions |

Framing messages allows positive and negative aspects be emphasized.

| Collaboratively                                | Competently                                       |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| I thought X. Can you show me what I'm missing? | You are wrong.                                    |
| I think you're right.                          | I knew that already                               |
| I like that idea.                              | That's unrealistic. <br />That will take forever. |

## What: Direct Messaging

Communication is often bi-directional and complex. It can be deconstructed into sending and receiving messages.

### Sending Messages

See [communication-monologues](communication-monologues.md).

#### Initiating contact / setting the state

...

#### Requesting Change

Motivation for change: a problem or opportunity.

Steps.

1. Align on the **problem**. Move from my problem to our problem.
2. Align on a **solution**. Define a desired state or objective.
3. Align on a **implementation**. Find a path to reach the objective.

#### Giving Feedback

> Giving feedback = disclosing information about yourself

Principles

- Let the other come up with a solution, rather than handing one directly to them. This increases follow-through.
- Separate the observation and your interpretation. Avoid judgement.
- Requests questions where "no" is an acceptable answer - in contrast with *demands*. When the answer is no, then empathize with the other's needs, rather than strengthening the request.

Steps for giving feedback. For sensitive topics or unpredictable receivers. Ensure alignment on each level.

1. **Event** (objective). Describe your observation of a signal.
2. **Effect** on yourself (subjective). Meaning, your interpretation.
3. **Pause**. Give the other space to accept, interpret and react.
    - Ensure there is alignment. Verify that the other can relate to your view?
4. **Desired** effect. Definition of success. What you need.
5. Suggestions or a **request**.

Template: alternative forms.

```markdown
- event-effect-pause
- observation-effect-you
- observation-feeling-need-request
```

##### Anti-patterns

- Mix the event and the subjective effect. The receiver might disagree with aspects in this statement and consequently neglect the whole message.
- Compliment sandwich. Pack criticism in between seemingly softening compliments, instead of being straightforward and sincere.

#### Delivering News

**Guidelines**

- Keep it simple. Don't make it bigger than it has to be. Find incremental steps / nuance.
- Decide what the most appropriate core message should be. Make it suitable to the current working relation.
  - Mention what you want in a addition to the news.
- Find an appropriate moment to deliver the news. This may be in a meeting or outside of business hours.
- Relate to the other. Ensure that the other accepts the message.

**Plan**

Although this usually happens between two people a plural form is used to allow for a more generic description.

1. Make **contact**. Set the stage and the tone.
    1. Initiate the interaction, ensure that the both parties are paying attention. E.g. "We have something important to tell you".
    2. (Optional) establish empathy. Acknowledge that there may exist strong emotions.

2. **Delivery** without explanation. Deliver the core message concisely. Don't immediately start a justification or defense.

3. Let the other **acknowledge** the message.
    1. Let the other party understand and then accept the message.
        1. Acknowledge the emotional reaction of the other party and attenuate it. For example, show genuine understanding, compassion. Apologize, offer reassurance or react non-verbally.
        2. Repeat this until the emotion or sentiment is cleared. If necessary, reiterate that the decision is final.

    2. Let the other party decide when it is time to continue (with an explanation or action point). If necessary repeat the third step.

4. **Explain** or justify the message or decision. Then keep acknowledging the emotional reaction and attenuate it.

5. **Future**
    1. In case of agreement or acceptance: continue with the How, start making concrete plans.
    2. In case of rejection: offer help, ask what is necessary to reach acceptance. Re-iterate your commitment to their wellbeing.

### Receiving Messages

See also

- Handling complaints
- Handling conflict
- Saying no (to the idea)

#### Receiving Feedback

Steps

- **Listen** to the message itself.
- **Interpret**. Feel the consequences. What's the result if this this hypothesis would be true?
- **Clarify**. Ask questions.
- **Evaluate** whether the message is useful.

#### Receiving Complaints

Note that a "mistake" can be defined as an event and an emotion.

1. Calm down: **come inside**
    1. Give the other the opportunity to complain or to let out rage. Let all complaints blow past you.
    2. Be on the same level down before discussing content

2. Acknowledgement: **sit down**
    1. Acknowledge the complaint, apologize, take responsibility.

3. **Focus**. Specification and reduction. Reduce chaos: choose a beverage
    1. Make the complaint concrete. Ask questions. Go from global/generic to local/specific.

4. **Align**. commit, make a promise
    1. Make commitment to find a solution. Note that this could merely alleviate the problem.

5. **Plan**. Discuss solutions: look outside
6. Ask/offer future collaboration.
7. Compliment: **farewell gift**

## Background

**Ambiguity**

[Natural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language) language is fundamentally flawed. It is ambiguous and it's meaning dependents on context and history. Surface-level language can be deconstructed to get closer to the true (deeper) meaning.

Anti-patterns & logical [fallacies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy) & [biases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_bias):

- Unspecified noun. *"This decision was made"* - by whom?
- Unspecified verb. *"They moved"*.  - how?
- Comparisons. *"It is better"* - what is the baseline?
- Judgements. *"Clearly, this is true"* - by who's authority?
- Nominalization. Using adjectives or verbs as nouns. *"The state of education "* - where are the nouns?
- Modal operators of possibility. *"It is impossible"* - in what conditions? what stops you?
- Modal operators of necessity. *"This should be done"* - what if? what happens if it doesn't?
- Universal quantifiers. (Over-)generalizations. *"Always"* - what are the exceptions?
- Complex equivalence. *"If-then"* - why does this implication hold?
- Pressuppositions. Assumptions. What leads to you to belief that?
- Cause and effect. Instead of attribution.
- Mind reading. E.g. projection of ones own feelings onto someone else, assuming an intent is obvious. - how exactly do you know?

**Emotions**

Bottled up emotions build up and can create tension. Risks:

- This tension influences conversations by “leaking through”.
- The emotions reduce the capability for (active) listening. Truly listening requires an open mindset.
- Risk of “explosions”.

**Events & Conflicts**

Conflicts are often caused by a difference in perspective. Many perspectives can be right at the same time.

An event can be deconstructed into three fundamental parts

1. The **intent** of the actor.
2. The **impact**. What happened.
3. The **effect** this had on the other. E.g. emotionally.

Incorporating these factors puts a positional argument into perspective.

**Representational systems**

- Kinesthetic - feeling
- Auditory - hearing
- Visual - seeing

**Perspectives**

First, second, third position.

1. The self. I, how I see/feel/hear it.
2. The other, with whom I interact.  How they see/hear/feel
3. An outside view. Someone who’s not involved. “Objective”
