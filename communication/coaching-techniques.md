# Coaching Techniques

## Contracting

The contracting phase aims to align expectations and give the coachee and coach a headstart. A contract is an informal or formal agreement on what to expect from each other. A less formal term would be *alliance*.

> Trust comes before agreement.

Start with developing a relation and building up trust. Initial agreements can be made on a abstract level. E.g. alignment on certain values or agreement on a title. Later agreements can be more specific.



**Coach contract**

Contract between coach and the coachee. The latter can be a team.

1. Introduction. what do you want to get out of this?
2. Context. Park the content 🅿️. What is important in these conversations?
3. Relationship. What do you need from each other?
4. Responsibility. How can we ensure that we keep these agreements? How can we make this easier?
```
