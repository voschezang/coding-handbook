# Communication Styles

[toc]

## Overview

Communication is dynamic, rather than static. It flows between pushing and pulling, and between goals and relation. You can take space and later give it back.

Communication changes when moving in and out [deep conversation](../conversations.md).



## Casual Conversation

Styles

- üî¶ Question the other. Demand a reaction.

- üí≠ Voice your thoughts or feelings. Disclose your opinion or make assertions about the environment.

- üëÇ Be interested. Be aware of non-verbal communication.



A question can be given as a demand or an invite.

- A **question** is an *assignment*. The other can respond by answering correctly, incorrectly or rejecting the question.

- A **wish** is an implicit assignment. The other may or may not acknowledge it.
- An **assertion** is neutral. You can share an observation or feeling. The other may or may not hear it.



**Communication styles (casual conversations)**

## Deep Conversation

Communication can focus on moving forward (towards a goal), connecting to each other, or to slow down and reconsider. See [change](../../subjects/change.md). Also see [styles](https://www.zuidema.nl/blog/stijlflexibiliteit-welke-stijl-zet-jij-in-om-effectief-te-communiceren).

### Pushing

Communication styles that help you move forward. Take in space. Emphasize ratio. Focus on content.

- **Asserting**. Make deliberate statements. Do this carefully, with precision. E.g. use:
  - Evualuations. *"That was good"*
  - Expectations. *"I expect X when Y"*
  - Consequences. "If X, then Y"
- **Persuading**. Use layers of arguments to strenghten your case. E.g. use
  - Proposals. *"I propose that ..."*
  - Reasons and facts. *"Because ..."*



Shared understanding --- persuade / change direction purpose

|            | üí° Asserting           | üó£Ô∏è Persuading                     |
| ---------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Method** | Statements            | Reasoning                        |
| **Focus**  | Shared understanding  | Judgement. Actions and decisions |
| **Scope**  | Context. Where we are | Goal. Where to go                |



### Pulling

Communication styles that emphasize connection. Invite the other to come closer.

|              | üí° Overcome difference                      | üëÇ Reduce difference     |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| **Why**      | Find a shared purpose. Find common ground. | Connect to each other.  |
| **What**     | Inspire, motivate                          | Empathize               |
| **Attitude** | Enthusiasm                                 | Curious,                |
| **Style**    | High energy, great ideas                   | Intimate, compassionate |
| **Method**   | Tell stories, envision possibilities.      | Ask, listen, disclose.  |

Connecting to the other may involve:

- Active listening. Verbally and non-verbally. Asking follow-up questions.
- Summarizing or paraphrasing what was said.
- Mentioning what you see. Suggesting evaluations.
- Disclosing. Express what you feel.



## Challenging

Requests and opinions can be challenged. One can use coaching or confronting stances. A few examples:

- Agreeable. *"I feel you, but also consider ..."*
- Polite. *"You mentioned X. Can we discuss that?"*
- Objective. *"Let's explore this from the perspective of ..."*
- Direct. *"I do see an alternative."*
- Assertive. *"That is not comletely true."*
- Aggressive. *"That is completely wrong."*
- Personal. *"You are mistaken."*

Conflict can be escalated.



## Bridging, Mediating, Negotiating

The difference between these can be a matter of framing.

- Ideal behaviour: depends on the role: from collaborating to competing.
- Find a fair deal. Mutual gain, objective criteria.

|          |              | Bridging         | Mediation            | Negotiation         |
| -------- | ------------ | ---------------- | -------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Why**  | **Purpose**  | Explore needs    | Shared goal.         | Individual goals    |
| **What** | **End-goal** | Learn and relate | Mutual gain. Win-win | Zero-sum game       |
| **How**  | **Emphasis** | Relation         | Interests            | Emphasize positions |

Framing messages allows positive and negative aspects be emphasized.

| Collaboratively                                  | Competently                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| I think you're right.                            | I knew that already                                          |
| I like that idea.                                | That's unrealistic. <br />That will take forever.<br />I can't do that. |
| I thought X. Can you show me what I'm missing?   | You are wrong.                                               |
| I see some challenges. How would you approach X? | X is a blocker.                                              |

**Addressing Conflict**

- Don't offer a compromise too soon. First aim for a shared understanding of both perspectives. Ensure that the other party understands your problem. Move away from a negotiation-oriented conversation to an open, learning conversation.

**Negotiating**

- Distinguish people from problems.
- Emphasize intent and value, rather than positions.
- Show/develop multiple options with varying benefits.
- Use objective criteria, to cultivate an attitude of fairness.



## Facilitating

>  Listening means showing interest

Facilitating styles

- Active listening. Non-verbal communication. E.g. nodding.
- Repeating
  - Summarizing
  - Paraphrasing. And then checking. And then re-paraphrasing. *"Such and so. Is that right?"*
  - Requesting.
    - *"Can you say that again?"*
    - *"Can you summarize that in one sentence?"*
  - Proposing. *"We could do ..."*

- Checking. *"Did you mean ...?"*



Levels of listening.

1. Paying **attention**. Non-verbal signals.

2. Summarizing, **paraphrasing** and checking.
3. Capture the **intent** behind a message, rather than the message itself.
4. Strategic listening. Become aware of second-order effects.
