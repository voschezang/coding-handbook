Also see [communication styles](./styles.md).

## Overview

> Words are irrelevant.

Communication is contextual. The context is more important than framing or content. 

- E.g. "no" can mean a lot of different things.
- The relation between people has a stronger effect on the meaning of sentences, than the sentences itself.



This document presents *classes* of reactions. Concrete example are added for clarification, but they are just that, examples.

#### RAIN

### Truth

Truth can mean different things.

- When building sharing context: *transparency*
- When disclosing: *honesty*

> Doubts are just a signal

- Sharing doubts puts a burdon on the listener. The listener needs to determine what to do with this information.
- Sharing needs gives the listener the option to be considerate.
