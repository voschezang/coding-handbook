## Overview

Storytelling is about appeal. Making people care at every moment.

It involves **strategic listening** and **dynamic speaking**. 

The former involves paying attention to care. 

- *What part of that story made me care?*
- *Is this about emotions, relations, thoughts ...?*
- *What is not being said?*

Dynamic speaking involves either:

- Action. Activity or contrast.
- Humor.
- Suspense. Blanks, expectations, negations.
- Stakes. Something significant. A reason to listen.

It is accompanied by a good vocal image and non-verbal context.



Practice

- Start with the end (but invert it).
- Don't say the thing. Create suspence.
- Make it personal. *What you felt. What you said. What you did.*



Examples

- Blanks. `When I looked, I wondered`
- Expectations. `It turned out to be even better...`
- Negations. `The light was neither red nor orange.`



Architecture

- 🐘 The elephant. The obvious thing in the story.
- 🌊 The stakes. The underlying meaning.
- 🧩 Puzzle pieces. Breadcrumbs. Clues. Hints to what's coming. Buildup.
- 🎒A backpack the audience caries with them. Shared context. A plan - that will unfold itself just a bit different.
- 🔮 A crystal ball. Predictions. People will want to know whether their predictions came out.
