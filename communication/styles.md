# Communication Styles

## Overview

Communication is dynamic, rather than static. It flows between pushing and pulling, and between goals and relation. You can take space and later give it back.

Communication changes when moving in and out deep conversation.

## Facilitating

>  Listening means showing interest

Facilitating styles

- Active listening. Non-verbal communication. E.g. nodding.
- Repeating
  - Summarizing
  - Paraphrasing. And then checking. And then re-paraphrasing. *"Such and so. Is that right?"*
  - Requesting.
    - *"Can you say that again?"*
    - *"Can you summarize that in one sentence?"*
  - Proposing. *"We could do ..."*

- Checking. *"Did you mean ...?"*



Levels of listening.

1. Paying **attention**. Non-verbal signals.

2. Summarizing, **paraphrasing** and checking.
3. Capture the **intent** behind a message, rather than the message itself.
4. Strategic listening. Become aware of second-order effects.
