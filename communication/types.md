# Collaboration

[toc]

## Overview

Styles. From short to long term. From concrete to abstract contracts.

- Command-driven. The employer tells the employee what to do.
- Desire-driven. The employer shares their desire with the employee. The employee reacts to his.
- Intent-driven. The employee anticipates the needs of the employer. E.g. propose initiatives.



## Conversations

See also [social dynamics](../collaboration/social-dynamics.md) and [personalities](../psychology/personality.md).

### Difficult Conversations

Three categories of "difficult" conversations:

1. What happened?
2. Emotions
3. Identity. See [organization](../collaboration/organization.md#Identity).



#### What happened?

Anti-pattern

- Belief: I'm right and you're wrong. 
- Goal: Convince the other.

Solution: Take a learning stance.

- Belief: Both perspectives are valid.
- Goal:  Learn to understand the other's perspective. Find a shared interest or purpose



Anti-pattern

- Belief: It's their fault.
- Goal: Justification.

Solution.

- Belief: Both parties contributed in some way.
- Goal: Figure out how this happened. Share my perspective; what happened and the effect on me.



#### Emotions

In general, emotions are normal and they can be expressed gradually.

Anti-pattern

- Emotions are excluded from the conversation entirely.
- Conversations are overly emotional.



### Emotional Conversations

Types of emotional conversations ([NVC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolent_Communication)).

- Self-empathy. Noticing the thoughs and feelings of the self - without judgement.
- Receiving empathically. Connecting with the other. Immersing fully with the other - without interpreting or understanding them.
- Expressing honestly. By default, this would involve an observation, feeling, need AND a request. See [communication](../collaboration/communication.md).



### Conflict

See [conflict](../collaboration/conflict.md).



#### In self-managing teams

Steps in an arising conflict.

1. Ensure the conflict can be discussed openly. Make it easy to deconstruct it.
2. Investigate the underlying causes. Discuss the situation one-on-one.
3. Escalate to management. Start with awareness and request advice.
    1. *"We observed this problem. We tried such and so. The result is ..."*
