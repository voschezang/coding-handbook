# Goals & Strategy

[toc]

> Making plans is good, withholding from updating them isn't.

> Good strategy means saying no.



**Terminology**

Specific types of goals

| Term         | Meaning |
| ------------ | ------- |
| Mission      | Why     |
| Vision       | What    |
| Strategy     | How     |
| Roadmap      | When    |
| Segmentation | Who     |
| Positioning  | Where   |
| Tactic       | ...     |

Note that these can be chosen for an *organization* and for each *product* within that organization.



## Roadmap

> Great outcome > meeting initial requirements.

> A goal is nothing without a good system to reach it.

A roadmap is a prototype of a strategy, rather than a list of everything that will be done. Make it flexible. Design for failure.

> Separate goals from dreams

It is great to have a long-term vision, but [good](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria) goals are a vital complement. In addition, idealistic outcomes are often difficult to measure and quantify. Hence (sub-)goals are used as a proxy.

An hierarchy of three layers:

**(1) High level / long term: North Star**

A few variants:

- North Star Goal: specific and measurable. A rough direction to go towards. Top of the goal/sub-goal hierarchy.
    - Make sure this metric is consistent with your definition of success.
    - Make sure this metric is clearly visible to the whole organization, such that they can align.
- Outcome or narrative: what the ideal state would look like. A vision.

Based on this high-level goal, you can start to trace back which steps are necessary to reach it. In addition, you can setup *inputs* or metrics to track progress.

**(3) Low-level / Short term: planning**

Use a rolling window. I.e. update the following list regularly/frequently. Reflect on results periodically and update them ad-hoc, on gaining new information.

1. Now: a handful of tasks that are currently worked on, and will be finished ASAP.
2. Next: 3 tasks that will be picked up next
3. Later: 1 task after that, and 1 task after that. However, if we learn more, then we might select one of these tasks instead.

Then find a way to align with the whole organization or team...

**(2) The messy middle**

Long-term goals are generally stable and short-term plans can be made continuously. Everything in between is inherently messy. The "middle" is based on the current worldview, but because it is specific it will become more and more obsolete as the environment changes. Hence it has to be from time to time.

- Do come up with a plan, but don't expect to stick to it. Build an abstract planning that is simple to adjust.
- Diversify; consider multiple approaches (bets) that try will help you to reach your goal from different angles.
    - e.g. have multiple [key results](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OKR).

A common tool to address the complexity of this area are OKRs. Do note that this works best *as a complement* to a long-term outcome.

In addition, the following tool can be used.

Denote a list of *narratives* and a list of *epics*. Ideally they correspond directly to each other, but in practice they may be interdependent.

- Narratives are abstract but intuitive. They are large enough to be significant and they are independent of the required input effort.
- Epics are more concrete. Implementation-oriented.They are based on the amount of required work.



### Living Roadmap

A roadmap becomes outdated over time due to:

- Internal changes. E.g. learning as part of the pre-planned progression.
- External changes. E.g. changes in the environment.

Hence, use a format that is resilient to change. This can be done by combining high-level and low-level descriptions.

#### Template

A template for a one-pager roadmap. This can be complemented with external sources.

1. A mission or vision. A perfect outcome.
2. North star goal. A great outcome. The minimum investment you want to make. This takes in cost and time constraints.
3. Current state and target state.
4. A list of next target states. Avoid a strict ordering, but do suggest a preference based on the current circumstances.

In addition, it can be useful to include *anti-goals*, i.e. which activities are excluded. This makes trade-offs explicit, and forces the authors to investigate their choices.

#### Way of working

Setting up dedicated ceremonies can help to ensure regular reflection, at the right timescale. E.g. in the form of meetings:

- Daily check-in meeting. Align and improve awareness.
- Weekly tactical meeting. React to short-term issues.
- Monthly strategic meeting. Decide on long-term adjustments.
- Quarterly off-site review. Take an outside-view and reflect.



## Models for Goal Setting

Different ways to set goals

**Legend**

- A. Current state
- B. Next target state, which will help towards Y and Z.
- Y. Required objective for Z.
- Z. North star goal

## Documentation

> Use documents to recall conversations rather than having them.

The goal is to externalize thinking. This helps to alignment the whole organization or team.

Summarize higher level in one-pages, but do use appendices (for details) and link to additional sources. See also [documentation](documentation.md).

**Assumptions & Facts**
For each goal, denote the assumptions and rationale. Be explicit in what's an assumption or uncertain.



### Tools

**Narrative**
Convey the feeling of an ideal state. E.g.*"1000 songs in your pocket"*
This is independent of the required input effort.

**Persona**
A model (or proxy) of the target market or audience. E.g. a typical user with a certain background.

**User Story**
What value a given feature would bring to a given *persona*. E.g.:

> As a `Persona` I want  `an action` because it will bring this `benefit` which helps to reach this `outcome`, based on the fact that `______`  and the assumption that `______`.

In order to be effective, a the scope should be limited to a few weeks.

**Epic**
A collection of user stories that can be finished in at most a handful of months.



## Goals

A goal should be accompanied with an *initiative* (input), *target* (output, result) and a *target condition* (objective, outcome).



The **goal** itself should be skewed towards the *Why* instead of the *What*. It should be an optimistic vision or mission.
- This includes a understanding of the relevant assumptions.
- Goals that are too high lead short term optimization (trying to survive instead of investing).
- Goal that are not high enough lead to a lack of focus.

**Initiative & Target**

Global optima are usually unknown in advance.

- Initially the target condition can be be a vague *challenge*. Missing details can be filled step by step, after reflection and experimentation. In fact, it is inevitable that you find new information when moving forward.
- Define the minimum amount of work that is required to reach an outcome and start there.

- Beware of changing the target condition to fit the current state.

**Metrics**

Use metrics as a tool to track incremental progress. Expectations for metrics should be ambitious but not impossible.

- Note that all metrics are flawed. They cannot be both generic and specific.
- Optimize targets and not [the measure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law) (avoid [perverse incientives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perverse_incentive)).

- Use different goals per timescale: `days, weeks, months, years, decades `. Relate shorter term goals to longer term goals. 

**Estimating**

Reasoning with probabilities and large numbers is harder than reasoning with small, discrete numbers

- `1 out of 8` is more intuitive than `12.5%`.
- Conglomerations are easier than continua and numeric values.

- Predict complexity of a tasks by the estimating the number of subtasks

Avoid personal bias. Instead of estimating your personal work (or your team), estimate what an other or similar person/team could achieve.

**Flow of Work**

The optimal size of batches, number of batching steps and the size of subtasks is context-dependent. Hence it should be optimized to current conditions, in concurrence with any target conditions.



**Choosing Goals**

Prioritization requires de-prioritization. This is inherently difficult. A few tools that can be used are:

- Select a single goal, that is absolutely necessary. E.g. address (or identify) the main constraint.

- Create a plot of the benefits as result of the effort required, for each possible goal.



Defining goals

- Bottom-up: First list features or desires, then define metrics.
- Top-down: Define a desired outcome, then define metrics to track progress towards that outcome, then list immediate actions. 



### Content of Tasks

Some tasks can be explained in a single sentence, but (large) tasks can be defined more thoroughly.

Before closing a task an appropriate review should be done to validate whether its purpose has been fulfilled.

#### Small Tasks

**Why** the need for change

- What problem does this task tackle?
    - Why does this need to be done now?

**What** is going to happen

- *Context*: What are the current and target conditions?
- *Proposal*: What is the proposed solution?
- *Outcome*: To what higher-level goal does this task relate?
    - What are the next steps?

**How** to implement the change

- What are the sub-tasks that are involved?
- What is the minimal scope of the task?

#### Larger Task

In addition to the above:

**Why this** investment should be made

- What is the cost in terms of time and effort?
- How much uncertainty is there?
- What are the side-effects?

**When** this investment should be made

- What is the risk of not picking this up?
- How long can this be deferred?

How **success** is going to be measured

- What metrics will be used to track progress?
