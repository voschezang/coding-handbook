Goals, planning, strategy



## Strategy & Vision

An hierarchy of three layers:

**(3) High level**

- North Star Goal: specific and measurable. A rough direction to go towards. Top of the goal/sub-goal hierarchy.
- Narratives: what the ideal state looks like. A vision.
    - E.g."1000 songs in your pocket"

**(1) Planning**

Use a rolling window. I.e. update the following list regularly/frequently. Reflect on results periodically.

1. Now: a handful of tasks that are currently worked on
2. Next: 3 tasks that will be picked up next
3. Later: 1 task after that, and 1 task after that

Then find a way to align with the whole organization or team.

**(2) The messy middle**

Long-term goals are generally stable and short-term plans made continuously / ad-hoc. Everything in between is messy. It is uncertain and is prone to change more frequently.



## Goals

- A goal should be skewed towards the *Why* instead of the *What*. It should be an optimistic vision or mission.
    - This includes a understanding of the relevant assumptions.
- Given a goal, formulate an *initiative* (input), *target* (output, objectives) and a *target condition* (outcome). 
- Use metrics as a tool to track progress. Expectations for metrics should be ambitious but not impossible.
    - Note that all metrics are flawed. 
    - Optimize targets and not [the measure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law) (avoid [perverse incientives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perverse_incentive)).
- Use different goals per timescale: `days, weeks, months, years, decades `. Relate shorter term goals to longer term goals. 



Ordering (kata)

1. Set an *optimistic* goal, vision, or mission (long-term).
2. Investigate & define the current state.
3. Choose a *realistic*, short-term target condition.
4. Remove any obstacles in between the current and target state. Fix problems and bottlenecks instead of settling on workarounds.
    - Note that this step is picked up *after* a target condition has been set.
    - Ideally there would be consensus about the previous steps. I.e. there is alignment about the target conditions.

Global optima are unknown in advance. Initially the target condition can be be a vague *challenge*. Missing details can be filled step by step, after reflection and experimentation. In fact, it is inevitable that you find new information when moving forward.

Beware of changing the target condition to fit the current state.





**Estimating**

Reasoning with probabilities and large numbers is harder than reasoning with small, discrete numbers

- `1 out of 8` is more intuitive than `12.5%`.
- Conglomerations are easier than continua and numeric values.

- Predict complexity of a tasks by the estimating the number of subtasks



Avoid personal bias. Instead of estimating your personal work (or your team), estimate what an other or similar person/team could achieve.



**Flow of Work**

The optimal size of batches, number of batching steps and the size of subtasks is context-dependent. Hence it should be optimized to current conditions, in concurrence with any target conditions.
