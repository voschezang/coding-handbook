# Goals Planning Strategy Vision



## Roadmap

> Great outcome > meeting initial requirements.

An hierarchy of three layers:

**(1) High level**

A few variants:

- North Star Goal: specific and measurable. A rough direction to go towards. Top of the goal/sub-goal hierarchy.
    - Make sure this metric is consistent with your definition of success.

- Outcome or narrative: what the ideal state would look like. A vision.
    - E.g."1000 songs in your pocket"

**(3) Planning**

Use a rolling window. I.e. update the following list regularly/frequently. Reflect on results periodically and update them ad-hoc, on gaining new information.

1. Now: a handful of tasks that are currently worked on
2. Next: 3 tasks that will be picked up next
3. Later: 1 task after that, and 1 task after that

Then find a way to align with the whole organization or team...

**(2) The messy middle**

Long-term goals are generally stable and short-term plans can be made continuously. Everything in between is inherently messy. The "middle" is based on the current worldview, but because it is specific it will become more and more obsolete as the environment changes. Hence it has to be from time to time.

- Do come up with a plan, but don't expect to stick to it. Build an abstract planning that is simple to adjust.
- Diversify; consider multiple approaches (bets) that try will help you to reach your goal from different angles.
    - e.g. have multiple [key results](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OKR).




**Documentation**

> Use documents to recall conversations rather than having them.

The goal is to externalize thinking. Alignment of the whole organization or team.

Summarize higher level in one-pages, but do use appendices (for details) and link to additional sources.



## Goals

- A goal should be skewed towards the *Why* instead of the *What*. It should be an optimistic vision or mission.
    - This includes a understanding of the relevant assumptions.
- Given a goal, formulate an *initiative* (input), *target* (output, result) and a *target condition* (objective, outcome).
    - Define the minimum amount of work that is required to reach an outcome and start there.

- Use metrics as a tool to track progress. Expectations for metrics should be ambitious but not impossible.
    - Note that all metrics are flawed. 
    - Optimize targets and not [the measure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law) (avoid [perverse incientives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perverse_incentive)).
- Use different goals per timescale: `days, weeks, months, years, decades `. Relate shorter term goals to longer term goals. 



Ordering (kata)

1. Set an *optimistic* goal, vision, or mission (long-term).
2. Investigate & define the current state.
3. Choose a *realistic*, short-term target condition.
4. Remove any obstacles in between the current and target state. Fix problems and bottlenecks instead of settling on workarounds.
    - Note that this step is picked up *after* a target condition has been set.
    - Ideally there would be consensus about the previous steps. I.e. there is alignment about the target conditions.

Global optima are unknown in advance. Initially the target condition can be be a vague *challenge*. Missing details can be filled step by step, after reflection and experimentation. In fact, it is inevitable that you find new information when moving forward.

Beware of changing the target condition to fit the current state.





**Estimating**

Reasoning with probabilities and large numbers is harder than reasoning with small, discrete numbers

- `1 out of 8` is more intuitive than `12.5%`.
- Conglomerations are easier than continua and numeric values.

- Predict complexity of a tasks by the estimating the number of subtasks



Avoid personal bias. Instead of estimating your personal work (or your team), estimate what an other or similar person/team could achieve.



**Flow of Work**

The optimal size of batches, number of batching steps and the size of subtasks is context-dependent. Hence it should be optimized to current conditions, in concurrence with any target conditions.





### Content of tasks

Subtasks can be explained in a single sentence, but (large) tasks can be defined more thoroughly.

The questions that should be answered are as follows (ordered by importance). This is based on [Kanban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban) and [PDCA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDCA).

Approach

- What problem does this task tackle? To what higher-level goal does this task relate?
- What are the current and target conditions?
- What are the risks associated with this approach?

Steps

- What are the sub-tasks that are involved?
- What is the minimal scope of the task?
- What are the next steps?

Before closing a task an appropriate review should be done to validate whether its purpose has been fulfilled.
