# Confidence

Confidence doesn't exit. It is just a belief. As a person, you can be skeptic or certain. Insecure or overly confident. 

People tend to favour people that *seem* confident. This is enhanced by what is said and how it is said.

*Caveat: This guide covers confidence. It does not give advice or make moral claims .*
