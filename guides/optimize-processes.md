# How to Optimize Processes

> Everything can be sped up.

The wrong way to optimize is to automate something, then speed it up, then simplify it and finally get rid of it completely. The opposite order is:

1. Understand the process. Walk through all the steps (together).
2. Delete (parts of) it.
3. Simplify it.
4. Speed it up.
5. Automate it.



## Background

> Deletion is painful.

Two styles:

- Aggressive. Overcorrect. Delete more that you should. Expect to put some steps back after deleting it.
- Conservative. Be overly careful. This leads to leads to accumulation of waste over time. 



**Anti-patterns**

- Optimize something that is not used.
