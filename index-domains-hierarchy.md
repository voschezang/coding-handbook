# Index Based on Quality

Reality can be ordered based on the [domains](metaphysics/domains.md) of quality.

[toc]

## Eternal Structures

Concepts that are not contingent upon lifeforms or matter. E.g.:

- Nothing. The empty set `∅`. The number `0`.
- Unity. The identity function `I`. The number `1`.
- Infinity: `∞` .
- `∫` [Functions](../domain-modelling/relations.md)

## Inorganic Structures

The world of physics. Matter and energy. E.g. atoms, molecules, natural forces.

## Biological Structures

Subjectivity. Specific lifeforms and the dynamics between them.

## Social Structures

Structures consisting of multiple lifeforms. Structures that exist in physical forms, but of which the purpose is the key characteristic. E.g. a nation is shared by people, rather than just a collection of property.
