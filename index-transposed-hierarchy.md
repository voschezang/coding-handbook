# Index

This is an index based on **particulars**, **categories** and **abstractions**, which are structures, types (of structures) and qualities (of structures), respectively. For each of these, there is a subdivision in four [domains](metaphysics/domains.md):

1. Objects. Inorganic structures.
2. Subjects. Biological beings. Experience, activity, connection.
3. Social structures. Organizations, communities, institutions, businesses, infrastructure, products, value chains.
4. Intellectual structures. Conventions, models. Things that exist in our minds.

Note that some documents contain multiple topics. Thus they fall into multiple categories. See [structures](metaphysics/structures.md) for examples of each category.

## Singular Instances

Named entities. Particulars.

- Uncategorized particulars
  - [metaphysics/quality.md](metaphysics/quality.md). Quality is the fabric of reality, hence there exists one instance of it.

- Objects. *E.g. The Suez Canal*
- Subjects. *E.g. Isaac Newton.*
- Social structures. E.g. humanity, the Netherlands or the University of Amsterdam.
