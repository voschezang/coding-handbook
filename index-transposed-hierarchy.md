# Index

This is an index based on particulars, categories and abstractions. For each of these, there are four [domains](metaphysics/domains.md):

1. Objects. Inorganic structures.
2. Subjects. Biological structures. People, experience, activity.
3. Social structures. Organizations, institutions.
4. Intellectual structures. Conventions, models.

## Singular Instances

Named entities. Particulars.

[metaphysics/quality.md](metaphysics/quality.md). Quality is the fabric of reality, hence there exists one instance of it.
