# Knowledge

This document discusses knowledge, truth and beliefs. See [objectivity](../metaphysics/objectivity.md) and [science](../intelligence/scientific-method.md).

[toc]

## Overview

Representation

- Directly, using language and [models.](modelling.md)
- Indirectly. Embedded into physical structures or behaviour. E.g. [genes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics) or [rituals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ritual).

Knowledge begins with similarity. It recognizes structures and patterns.



## Domains

Science attempts to organize knowledge. It relates to the following domains.

| Domain            | Quality (Emphasis)     | Bias                  | Artifact                    |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Art               | Beauty                 | Imitation             | Text, paintings, sculptures |
| Engineering       | Production, usefulness | Efficiency            | Products                    |
| Humanities        | Subjectivity           | Cultural              | Stories                     |
| Philosophy        | Theoretical knowledge  | Questioning, idealism | History of philosophy       |
| (Natural) Science | Objective knowledge    | Facts, truth          | Papers                      |




 üìñ **Science**

The [scientific method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method) focusses on acquiring knowledge through experiments and publications. It consists of making falsifiable [predictions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothesis) and attempts to make generalizations. It can be split up into natural, formal, social and applied science.

- It is biased towards physical objects and their measurable properties. It tends to de-emphasize subjective experience.
- Science, and especially the subject-object split has clear limits. It does not cover (moral) values. The boundary includes the following:
    - In mathematics. [Axioms of mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems).
    - In physics. The [standard model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_particle) and [relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_relativity). [Quantum gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_gravity). [Dark matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter).
    - Before physics. [Metaphysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaphysics).
    - Subjectivity: [aesthetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics) and [morality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morality).
- It does describe fundamental parts of reality incredibly accurately.
    - [Waves and particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave%E2%80%93particle_duality). [Motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion). [Thermodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamics).
    - [Forces of nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_interaction).
    - [Mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics): [Logic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic), [statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics).




üí≠ **Philosophy**

Philosophy is related to science. It is not strictly part of science, because it questions science itself and even our own existence and [objectivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivity_and_subjectivity) itself. 

- It also covers ethics, which is grounded on [subjective experience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_zombie). See [personhood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personhood).

> Philosophy is fundamentally destabilizing.

This is unlike science, which attempts to provide structure and predictability.



üî® **Engineering**

Engineering differs from science in its purpose. It's about solving problems rather than discovering truth. It involves production on top of learning. Reliability is considered sufficient, rather than seeing absolute truth.



üé® **Art**

> L'art pour l'art.

Art differs from engineering in its purpose. It's about creation itself. It's about aesthetic and uniqueness, rather than mass-production. It can be completely [decoupled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_for_art%27s_sake) form any utility. It focusses on value, rather than objects.

Explore the human condition: experience and beliefs. Language, culture and society.
