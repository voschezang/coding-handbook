## Overview

Learning is facilitated by [models](modelling.md). Learning is the process of updating these models.

- As humans, we use [mental models](mental-models.md) to make sense of the world. In practice, we create these ourselves.
    - Communicating models is requires more than merely listing the components in a model.



In intuitive learning, the environment is designed to facilitate learning. The learner encounters a wide range of aspects of a topic.

For studying, specific topics are chosen deliberately.

|                 | Intuitive                          | Studying                           |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Core**        | Appreciation, discovery, immersion | Abstraction and deep understanding |
| **Bias**        | Application                        | Fundamentals                       |
| **Method**      | Exposure and repetition            | Lectures and books                 |
| **Effort**      | Unconsciously                      | Dedication                         |
| **Focus**       | Wide                               | Specific                           |
| **Association** | Children that play                 | Adults that work                   |

Playing, acting, role playing are all forms of learning. They let you explore both alternate realities andt the extreme of the current reality.



## Formal Learning

[Learning cycles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_cycle). See [Kolb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolb%27s_experiential_learning).

| Phase                             | Activity                 |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Experience and observation        | Gather data              |
| Reflection and introspection      | Analyze & process data   |
| Abstraction and conceptualization | Define model             |
| Hypothesis and experimentation    | Test boundaries of model |



### Learning Types

> Learning revolves around revising your opinions.

Experiments not require complex setups. Start simple and expand if necessary. A few types:

1. 💭 Thought experiments. Consider a hypothetical scenario and how it will play out.
2. 👀 Learn by observation. Then reflect on the observations.
3. 🐸 Iterate. Change a specific variable and measure the effect. Then repeat. See [leapfrog method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leapfrog_integration).
4. 🧪 Experiment. E.g. A/B testing.
    1. Replicate multiple environments.
    2. Change one of them and use the other one as a baseline.
    3. Compare the results.

This can be done in a formal way. See [scientific method](knowledge.md#Scientific%20Method).



A few dimensions:

- Top-down or bottom-up.
- Invite or inflict change.
- Revolutionary or evolutionary change.



**Tension-release**

Push & pull. Similar to a dialogue, there should be a two-way interaction. Cross boundaries shortly, then step back and reflect. This allows you to maintain flow.

Two phases:

- 🤩 Make new connections. Explore & discover. Observing without judgement.
- 🤔 Make abstractions. Reflect and process knowledge. Assimilate and integrate knowledge. Re-evaluta phenemena.

Two phases:

- 🔭 Go wide. Discover ranges and possibilities.
- 🔬 Go deep. Discover details. Define boundaries.



**Change**

Psychologically, change can be difficult for both individuals and groups. There are a few stages to go though - at the right pace.

1. Awareness of the challenge or obstacle. Awareness of the difference between the current and desired states.
2. Acceptance of the current state. Awknowledge its limitations, but also the realization that change is possible. 
3. Agency. Decide on the right target state. Be able to move towards it.



## Organizational Learning

An optimal learning environment has:

- A teacher/coach/facilitator
- Other learners
- Customer or real-world feedback

Learning requires both theory and practice (experimentation). Making mistakes is a vital part of learning.

- Prefer collaboration over competition. The latter discourages mistakes, and thus hampers learning.

Learning on a local level is easy, but learning at the "middle management level" is not (e.g. due to competition, fear of failure).

Local improvements and adaptation are a vital complement to top-down strategies.

- This requires alignment on all levels. Hence higher management should share their vision and strategy within the organization.
- Local improvements are usually easier than global ones.



## Practice (Context)

### Organizations & Processes

The ideal learning strategy depends on the [environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynefin_framework). See [domains](../systems/structure.md).

- Chaotic: act-sense-respond
- Complex: probe-sense-respond
- Complicated: sense-analyse-respond
- Obvious: sense-categorise-respond

### Learning

Other patterns

- plan-do-check-act
- imitate-assimilate-innovate
- inspect-adapt-reflect
- visualize-stabilize-optimize



## Learning Models

**Consicous competence**

1. *Un*conscious *in*competence
2. Conscious *in*competence
3. Conscious competence
4. *Un*conscious competence

After this, one could go back and zoom in on specific behaviours that can be improved.

- Unlearning: from 4. to 2.
- Relearning: from 2. to 4.

| ...                          | Recollection: Situational instead of non-Situational | Recognition: Holistic instead of decomposed | Decision: Intuitive instead of analytical | Awareness: Absorbed instead of monitoring |

**[Shuhari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuhari) model**

1. Obey. Follow traditions, learn fundamentals, heuristics, proverbs.
2. Digress. Break with tradition.
3. Separate, transcendence. Exceed tradition. Find new ways

**Teaching models - roles**

[Source](https://twitter.com/andybudd/status/1557757908166877186)

- Consultant: Here, let me fix that problem for you
- Mentor: This is what I did when I had that problem
- Advisor: Here are a few things people do to solve that problem
- Coach: What can you do to solve that problem?

**Zones**

- Comfort zone. Easy, stable, safe.
- Growth zone. Alive, anticipation, challenge, excitement.
- Panic zone. Anxiety, stress, fear, tension.



## Asking Good Questions

**Tools / Deconstruction**

Remove "self"

- "How do *I* do X" → "*Who* knows how to do X?"

Deconstruct implications

- "How can I do X better?" → "What does *better* mean?"

Question the origin

- "How did you come to that question?"

Mirror questions

- "What do you think/feel about it?"



**In Coaching**

- Oppurtunity > blame. What tools do you need to succeed? ~~Why did you fail?~~



**In Teaching**

See [socratic questioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_questioning).

- Origin. *Could you explain that further? What do you base that on?*
- Assumptions. *Is that always true? What would need to happen for that to change?*
- Evidence. *Could this evidence be incomplete?*
- Perspectives. *What alternatives are there? Who beliefs otherwise?*
- Implications / consequences. *If X, then what about Y? What's the effect on Z?*
- Reflect. *What makes this question important? Why is it useful?*



**Mu**

Mu is a rejection to a given binary question. It is defined as "not true and not false".

- In science, *mu* answers suggest that there is more to the question. They form a basis to continue investigating.
- Moreover, they suggest that the initial question / hypothesis is somehow lacking - that it originates from a limited perspective.
