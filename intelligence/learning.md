## Overview

Learning is facilitated by [models](modelling.md). Learning is the process of updating these models.

- As humans, we use [mental models](mental-models.md) to make sense of the world. In practice, we create these ourselves.
    - Communicating models is requires more than merely listing the components in a model.



**Learning Types**

> Learning revolves around revising your opinions.

Experiments not require complex setups. Start simple and expand if necessary. Three types:

1. Learn by observation. Then reflect on the observations.
2. Iterate. Change a specific variable and measure the effect. Then repeat.
3. Experiment. E.g. A/B testing.
    1. Replicate multiple environments.
    2. Change one of them and use the other one as a baseline.
    3. Compare the results.

This can be done in a formal way. See [scientific method](knowledge.md#Scientific%20Method).



A few dimensions:

- Top-down or bottom-up.
- Invite or inflict change.
- Revolutionary or evolutionary change.



**Tension-release**
Push & pull. Similar to a dialogue, there should be a two-way interaction. Cross boundaries shortly, then step back and reflect. This allows you to maintain flow.



## Organizational Learning

An optimal learning environment has:

- A teacher/coach/facilitator
- Other learners
- Customer or real-world feedback

Learning requires both theory and practice (experimentation). Making mistakes is a vital part of learning.

- Prefer collaboration over competition. The latter discourages mistakes, and thus hampers learning.

Learning on a local level is easy, but learning at the "middle management level" is not (e.g. due to competition, fear of failure).

Local improvements and adaptation are a vital complement to top-down strategies.

- This requires alignment on all levels. Hence higher management should share their vision and strategy within the organization.
- Local improvements are usually easier than global ones.



## Practice (Context)

### Organizations & Processes

The ideal learning strategy depends on the [environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynefin_framework). See [domains](../systems/structure.md).

- Chaotic: act-sense-respond
- Complex: probe-sense-respond
- Complicated: sense-analyse-respond
- Obvious: sense-categorise-respond

### Learning

Other patterns

- plan-do-check-act
- imitate-assimilate-innovate
- inspect-adapt-reflect
- visualize-stabilize-optimize



## Learning Models

**Consicous competence**

1. *Un*conscious *in*competence
2. Conscious *in*competence
3. Conscious competence
4. *Un*conscious competence

After this, one could go back and zoom in on specific behaviours that can be improved.

- Unlearning: from 4. to 2.
- Relearning: from 2. to 4.

**[Shuhari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuhari) model**

1. Obey. Follow traditions, learn fundamentals, heuristics, proverbs.
2. Digress. Break with tradition.
3. Separate, transcendence. Exceed tradition. Find new ways

**Teaching models - roles**

- Consultant: Here, let me fix that problem for you
- Mentor: This is what I did when I had that problem
- Advisor: Here are a few things people do to solve that problem
- Coach: How do you think you might solve that problem?

**Zones**

- Comfort zone. Easy, stable, safe.
- Growth zone. Alive, anticipation, challenge, excitement.
- Panic zone. Anxiety, stress, fear, tension.



## Asking Good Questions

**Tools / Deconstruction**

Remove "self"

- "How do *I* do X" → "*Who* knows how to do X?"

Deconstruct implications

- "How can I do X better?" → "What does *better* mean?"

Question the origin

- "How did you come to that question?"

Mirror questions

- "What do you think/feel about it?"



**In Coaching**

- Oppurtunity > blame. What tools do you need to succeed? ~~Why did you fail?~~



**In Teaching**

See [socratic questioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_questioning).

- Origin. *Could you explain that further? What do you base that on?*
- Assumptions. *Is that always true? What would need to happen for that to change?*
- Evidence. *Could this evidence be incomplete?*
- Perspectives. *What alternatives are there? Who beliefs otherwise?*
- Implications / consequences. *If X, then what about Y? What's the effect on Z?*
- Reflect. *What makes this question important? Why is it useful?*



**Mu**

Mu is a rejection to a given binary question. It is defined as "not true and not false".

- In science, *mu* answers suggest that there is more to the question. They form a basis to continue investigating.
- Moreover, they suggest that the initial question / hypothesis is somehow lacking - that it originates from a limited perspective.
