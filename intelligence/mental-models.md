# Mental Models

Mental models are personal ideas that affect how one perceives the world. They are never correct or complete. In fact, they are useful because they show the boundaries of a theory. The ability to develop these models is as important as the models themselves. See [modelling](modelling.md).

## Overview

Rigidity. Worldviews.

- Dualisms. Binary, black-white, left-right, us-them, good-bad.
- Holism. Unity, cohesion. Idealistic.
- Zen. Both singular and plural. Multiple correct models. Free of rigid rules.





## Building Models

|                              | A Priori            | Evidence-based                                     |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Application** (Real world) | Inference           | Comparison, intuition, random sampling (anecdotes) |
| **Theory** (Ideal world)     | Fundamental / logic | Rational analysis                                  |

**Thinking**

Conceptual and visual thinking. Associative and linear thinking.

|                       | Conceptual (Word, Facts)                                | Visual / Spatial                                             | Subconscious              |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| **Type**              | Analytical                                              | Associations                                                 | Intuition                 |
| **Categorization**    | Definitions, negation                                   | Similarity                                                   | Outside of language       |
| **Collect knowledge** | Sequentially, linear                                    | Emergent                                                     | Letting go of assumptions |
| **Inference**         | [Binary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_algebra) | [Bayesian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_inference) | -                         |



## Applying Models

**Decision making**

|            | Abstraction-based                      | Example-based               |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Observing  | Fundamentals, deconstruct observations | Remember interpretations    |
| Evaluation | Self-reflection. Evaluate models       | Free of judgement           |
| Prediction | Inference                              | Compare, translate examples |

**Reasoning**

|                        | Internal                     | External                      | Instinct              |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------- |
| **Method**             | Fundamentals                 | Comparisons & interpretations | Intuition             |
| **Awareness**          | Self-aware. Self-reflection. | Automatic. Auto-pilot.        | Instinct, unconscious |
| **Locus of attention** | Internal memories.           | The present, the world.       | Broad                 |
| **Speed**              | Slow.                        | Fast.                         | Medium                |
| **Mental models**      | Question models              | Apply models                  | No preconceptions     |



## Updating models

Phases (similar to the scientific method).

- Observe. Collect data.
- Experiment. Gather data. Test hypotheses.
- Analyze / translate / generalize. Synthesize.



**Bottom-up & top-down learning**

Extremes of the spectrum

- Build guidelines from the ground up, based on experience.
- Imagine an ideal model, then test it in the real world.

Comparison

|                         | Bottom-up                  | Top-down                                    | Intuitive                      |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Start with**          | Repetition (practice)      | Deep understanding (theory)                 | Clean slate                    |
| **Then, continue with** | Reflection                 | Apply knowledge, verify a theoretical model | Avoid language, preconceptions |
| **Focus on**            | Likelihood                 | Certainty, perfection (idealism)            | Exploration, questioning       |
| **Aim for**             | Get to 80% ASAP            | Get to 100%, eventually                     | Flow                           |
| **Reasoning**           | Generalization (induction) | Logical inference (deduction)               | Intuition                      |

Risks of bottom-up learning

- Inability to generalize, due to lack of fundamental understanding.
- Over-confidence.

Risks of top-down learning

- Overfitting, over-engineering.
- Procrastination.
- Overly critical.

The exception to this is learning like a child would. Being open-minded, without preconceptions or judgement. Moving with a feeling of wonder, using intuition.
