# Scientific Method

> Science consists of making falsifiable predictions.

Broadly, the [scientific method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method) consists of a prior belief, a conjecture (hypothesis), and an experiment. Specifically:

1. **Problem statement** or observation. Explore. Do research.
2. **Hypothesis**. A falsifiable prediction. Use *induction* to predict a hypothetical situation. Make a generalization based on an observation. These can range from analogies, causal inferences, syllogisms.
3. **Experiment**. Design an experiment to test the hypothesis. Use *deduction* to ensure that conclusions are valid; both in terms of syntax and semantics. This may be done with either a formal or a natural language. A inherent challenge is to maximize the likelihood `P(E | H)`.
4. **Analyze**. Observe the results and compare them to the *predicted* results. `P(H | E)`
5. **Conclude**. Draw conclusions without over-generalizing.
6. **Report** findings and share them freely. Facilitate other researchers to replicate the experiments.



There are parallels with [Bayesian inference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_inference).

- The problem statement is the prior `P(H)`: the probability that the hypothesis `H` is true.
- The hypothesis and the experiment are the likelihood `P(X | H)`: the probability of observing the predicted result `X`, if the hypothesis would be true.
- The conclusion is the posterior `P(H | X`): the probability that the hypothesis is true, given the observation.



Challenges

- In practice, it my be impossible to proof that an hypothesis is true. Instead, a combination of experiments can be setup to disprove or reject any alternative hypothesis.
- The number of possible hypotheses is infinite. Science does not prescribe how to choose or select the right hypothesis. There is an *art* to thinking outside the box and coming up with novel hypotheses.
