## Principles

>  The interview should be a conversation rather than an exam.

Preparation & way of working
- Make notes and revisit them afterwards
- Prepare creative questions, personalized to the other party
- Ask for references: both of the employee and the employer.

During interview/conversation
- Ask open questions (why, what, how,...)
- Don't fire-and-forget, instead pause (and elaborate) on each question.
- React to answers, come up with two counter-questions

Intro
- What do you want to talk about?
- What do expect?

Context
- Understand the other's motivation, passion, drives, desires.



**Tools**

Levels for queries

- Storytelling. "Describe an experience about X"
- Improve / role-playing. A hypothetical situation. "Image X. How would you respond?"
- ...



**Purpose**

Job interview

- Estimate suitableness of candidate and the role.
- Determine level of knowledge, skill and experience of candidate.

### Practice

Then come back to this occasionally.

#### For Interviewees

**Job interview**

Ask the interviewer at the beginning:

Then tailor the rest of the conversation towards this.
