# Labour

This document presents a liberal taxonomy of labour, work and management. It is inspired by from various fields, for example [systems science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_science) and [business administration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_administration). Labour can be defined as ([src](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(human_activity))):

> Labour is human activity directed at meeting necessities for self-preservation and the reproduction of the species. Because these needs cannot be satisfied once and for all, labour never really reaches an end [...] a futile but necessary activity.

This contrasts with *work*, which has a clearly defined beginning and end. This [instrumental](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumentalism) property creates a bias towards purposefulness. [Product management](product-management.md) often focusses on delivering value to a customer. The interests of employees, citizens and climate should also be taken into account.

## Purpose and Sustainability

The purpose of any type of labour can be deconstructed in *discovery* and *delivery*. The former is both an [existential](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existentialism) question and a [validation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verification_and_validation) of beliefs and posibilities. Delivery is more concrete, and consists of the following:

- Add value now. To either the being (or organization) itself or to its environment. This includes monitoring and verification.
- Add value in the future. Ensure self-preservation and be able to adapt. E.g. by assuring access to capital.

A secondary set of goals is to do this *sooner, safer* and *happier*.

## Objectives and Initiatives

At minimum, labour requires the selection of an *objective* and an *initiative* to achieve it. This requires alignment with stakeholders and gathering of resources.

The initiative is meant to move from a *current stateI* to a *target state*. This requires a transcendence of [inertia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton's_laws_of_motion) - otherwise there would be no need for the initiative at all. The transcendence is made possible by [consuming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_law_of_thermodynamics) *resources*. The promise of change may or may not be enough to obtain these.

<img src="img/objective-initiative.png" alt="objective-initiative" style="width:60%;" />

Choosing the right objective and initiatives is a challenge in itself. See [goals](goals-planning-strategy.md). After choosing a goal, one can specify [requirements](requirements-engineering.md).



## Organized Labour

Labour can be divided into *processes* and *projects*. It is done by a person or an *organization* and it involves *resources*. Often it involves of various sorts. Al of these concepts may involve [management](management-principles.md).



How to run an organization.

1. Set clear, time-bound objectives (see above).
2. Ensure that the organization is working towards them.
3. Setup periodic reflection moments at appropriate time scales. E.g. daily, bi-weekly, quarterly, yearly meetings.



Cycle

1. Take a step back / reflect
2. Make or update plans. Choose a direction.
3. Execute plans. Move forwards.
4. Repeat



**Autonomous teams**

A top-down approach where teams execute pre-specified plans is straightforward and works well in certain environments. Whenever teams need to adapt quickly this approach starts to fail. 

- Alignment with other teams. Being aware of the greater purpose.
- Reflection of the team itself, it's work and it's environment.
- Adapting objectives and plans based on progress.



**Roles in Teams**

There exist multiple models for [role and responsibility assignment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsibility_assignment_matrix). A few fundamental roles:

- Accountable for the end-result.
- Responsible for execution.
- Consulted. E.g. providing consultancy or support.
- Informed. Following along.

Roles can be official and persistent, or informal and dynamic.



### Projects and processes

- A process is a pre-defined method to do labour. It may involve repetition and it may be optimized by improving reliability and speed.
- A [project](project-management.md) involves a change of some sort. It's too unique or uncertain be be a process. It may require adaption.

#### Change

See [requirements-engineering](requirements-engineering.md).



**Proposing change**

Align on the questions: *Why change? For whom? Why now?*

1. **Context**. Align on the current state. What is the complication? What is the problem or opportunity? What is the context?
2. **Question** the current state. Belief that "we" can change this soon. What can be different? Which assumptions are false?
3. **Answers**. Propose actions to take.

Then make a plan.



**Planning change**

Determine how to make change possible and worthwhile. Given an *objective*, consider:

- The deliverables
- The initiatives. The in input effort.
- Estimation of the cost
- Risks



**Managing change**

Distinguish day-to-day activities from focus.

- Health [indicators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_indicator) for *business as usual*.
- Short-term [objectives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OKR) for *change*.

Visualization

- Kanban or Scrum board. Show work in progress and planned work.
- Heatmap of health indicators.



#### Identity

Labour can be performed by an [organization](organization-structure.md) or [system](systems-management.md). An organization may define itself on different levels. Based on Bateson's pyramid.

1. Meaning. Awareness of identity. What should our identity be?
2. Identity. Who are we?
3. Values. Give this identity, what do we value?
4. Beliefs. How do these values relate to the real world.
5. Capability. What are we capable of doing?
6. Behavior. What are we doing?
7. Environment. What is outside of us?

These influence decisions. For example, belief is a prerequisite for making changes - and can limit capability. E.g.

```markdown
**We      cannot do         this     here**
_identity belief capability behavior environment_
```



## Labour Itself

Labour can be categorized as follows. Based on [environments](https://cynefin.io/wiki/Cynefin), ranging from `chaotic-complex-complicated-obvious`. 

It may have the following forms:

1. Research (theoretical, experimental), deconstruct the application domain.
2. Development: novelty, effectiveness, build/improve an application. I.e. invest and introduce change.
3. Operations: efficiency & quality, run a black-box application. I.e. cut cost and block change. Execute a process.
4. Administration: consistency, manage a black-box application. Audit an executed process.

*Management* of labour usually falls under operations or administration. It differentiates itself from "actual" work by distancing itself from it. E.g. through delegation or orchestration.



## Assignments

Initiatives can be defined as assignments or projects that are difficult in some sense. For a given a project there are two phases to consider: planning and execution. Both are [vital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verification_and_validation) to:

- Deliver the right thing
- Deliver it right

**Planning**

Requirements are set to to ensure that an initiative results in the desired outcome - or decrease the change of surprises.

Risk management is done to identify and address risks.

**Execution**

After a planning phase, the initiative is executed. Next to following the plan, this may require:

- Updating plans & managing resources.
- Informing stakeholders & managing expectations.

**Feedback**

Updating [prior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_inference) beliefs using new information. This requires observation, analysis and reflection. See [modeling](modeling.md).

**Improvement**

Change [organizational structure](organization-structure.md) and the environment. See [learning](learning.md).



## Work Principles

> Principles before process



**`0` Zero quality layers**

Instead, build-in quality and improvement into every stage or component. In organizations, let everyone improve, rather than hiring a consultant to do it for them.



**`1` Focus**

> Focus means saying no

- Limit [WIP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_in_process). Focus on flow. Be inefficient. Multitasking is wasteful. Be long term patient and short term impatient.
- Limit change-in-progress. Cognitive overhead is demanding of employees - it drains energy
- Strive for 1 goal per timescale.



**`∞` Continuous improvement**

- Assume ignorance. Be ready to learn.

- Design for failure. Setup experiments that can fail. Do risk management.
- Think big and work small.



**`∀` Agile**

> Happy teams, happy customers

Agile is not a goal in itself. Rather, increase agility in order to deliver value faster, sooner, safer and happier.

- Better: quality.
- Happier: colleagues, customers. Incl. a good level of challenge.
- Sooner: lead time, throughput, flow efficiency.
- Safer: risk, continuous compliance, security.



**`3` The DevOps Way**

1. Flow through value chain.
2. Feedback loops. Include customer feedback.
3. Continuous improvement.



**`6σ` Lean**

Applicable to *complicated* rather than *complex* domains

1. Focus on customer value
2. Identify value stream, from concept to cash
3. Flow, minimize lead time, flow efficiency
4. Pull, don’t over produce
5. Strive for perfection, high quality.  This is mostly for *complicated* rather than *complex* domains



**`Δ` Think big, work small. Long term patient, short term impatient**

- Think big, work small. Align on a high level and release in small increments.

- Be long term patient but short term impatient. Long term: be able to see things through. Short term: focus on continuous but direct improvements.
- Separate goals and dreams. Be impatient in reaching goals, but patient when working towards a dream.
- Micro pessimist, macro optimist
- Separate goals and dreams. Be impatient in reaching goals, but patient when working towards a dream.
