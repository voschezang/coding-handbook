# Labour

A definition ([src](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(human_activity))):

> Labour is human activity directed at meeting necessities for self-preservation and the reproduction of the species. Because these needs cannot be satisfied once and for all, labour never really reaches an end [...] a futile but necessary activity.

This contrasts with *work*, which has a clearly defined beginning and end. This [instrumental](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumentalism) property creates a bias towards purposefulness. [Product management](product-management.md) often focusses on delivering value to a customer. The interests of employees, citizens and climate should also be taken into account. 



**Objectives and Initiatives**

At minimum, labour requires the selection of an *objective* and an *initiative* to achieve it. This requires alignment with stakeholders and gathering of resources.

The initiative is meant to move from a *current stateI* to a *target state*. This requires a transcendence of [inertia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton's_laws_of_motion) - otherwise there would be no need for the initiative at all. The transcendence is made possible by [consuming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_law_of_thermodynamics) *resources*. The promise of change may or may not be enough to obtain these.

Choosing the right objective and initiatives is a challenge in itself. See [goals](goals-planning-strategy.md).



**Management**

Labour can be divided into *processes* and *projects*. It is done by a person or an *organization* and it involves *resources*. Often it involves [systems](systems-management.md) of various sorts. Al of these concepts may involve [management](management-principles.md).

- A process is a pre-defined method to do labour. It may involve repetition and it may be optimized by improving reliability and speed.
- A [project](project-management.md) involves a change of some sort. It's too unique or uncertain be be a process. It may require adaption.

## Assignments

Initiatives can be defined as assignments or projects that are difficult in some sense. For a given a project there are two phases to consider: planning and execution. Both are [vital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verification_and_validation) to:

- Deliver the right thing
- Deliver it right

**Planning**

Requirements are set to to ensure that an initiative results in the desired outcome - or decrease the change of surprises.

Risk management is done to identify and address risks.

**Execution**

After a planning phase, the initiative is executed. Next to following the plan, this may require:

- Updating plans & managing resources.
- Informing stakeholders & managing expectations.

**Feedback**

Updating [prior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_inference) beliefs using new information. This requires observation, analysis and reflection. See [modeling](modeling.md).

**Improvement**

Change [organizational structure](organization-structure.md) and the environment. See [learning](learning.md).
