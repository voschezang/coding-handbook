# Accountability

**Accountability** is the key factor that distiguishes roles and responsibilities. This document presents a generic model for accountability.

First, let's distinguish the **production** process and its **product**. These yield the first two accountabilities. Production is enabled through **capabilities**. Usually this is a mix of *technical* and *organizational* capability.

Note that all of this is influenced by the external world: the **context**. There is a boundary of things that are in control of the organization. Accountability cannot trancend this boundary.

| **Accountability** | Value delivery (to customers)  | Quality (of production) | The environment                                           |
| **Focus**          | Delivery                       | Creation                | Enabling                                                  |
| **Roles**          | Product owner, project manager | Developer               | People manager, team lead, team coach                     |
| **Activity**       | Coordinate, priorize           | Produce                 | Enable, support, coach                                    |
| **Scope**          | Value chain                    | Production chain        | Team environment                                          |
| **Value**          | Results, lead time             | Quality, throughput     | Agility, effectiveness, empiricism, consistency, maturity |

Examples of accountabilities for capability:

- Working empirically. Transparency, reflection.
- Effectiveness. Ensuring commitments, attention to results.
