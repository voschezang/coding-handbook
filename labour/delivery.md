# Delivery

Delivery is about realizing ideas. The result of a delivery process is called a product.

Realization can happen in increments. Strategies typically optimize for efficiency or predictability. The former takes risk by building large increments. The latter minimizes risk by testing early. See [increments](increments) and [initiatives](initiatives.md).

Product increments tend to follow a release pipeline. In software engineering the phases are typically: 

- `requirements, analysis, design, implementation, testing, deployment`.

### Agile and Waterfall Projects

Watefall-type projects start with full requirements. Development and testing happens afterwards, in sequence. Agile approaches start earlier with (functional) testing and then improve the design in increments.

|                     | Waterfall                 | Agile                   |
| ------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| **Optimize for**    | Throughput (output)       | Market fit (outcome)    |
| **Scope**           | Requirements drive design | Discovery drives design |
| **Decision making** | Theoretical (top-down)    | Empirical               |
| **Testing**         | Eventually                | Continuously            |
| **Worst case**      | Project fails             | Project is insufficient |

This graph shows the granularity of increment verses the development stages. The steepness of the line is associated with risk apetite.

For software projects the increments follow a typical form.
