# Documentation

> Use documentation to recall conversations rather than as an alternative for them.

The goal of documentation is to externalize thinking. This helps with aligning the whole organization.

Summarize higher level in one-pages, but do use appendices (for details) and link to additional sources. See also [writing documentation](../documentation.md).



## Tools

**Narrative**
Convey the feeling of an ideal state. E.g.*"1000 songs in your pocket"*
This is independent of the required input effort.

**Persona**
A model (or proxy) of the target market or audience. E.g. a typical user with a certain background.

**User Story**
What value a given feature would bring to a given *persona*. See these [templates](../management/requirements-engineering.md).

**Epic**
A collection of user stories that can be finished in at most a handful of months.

**MVP**
See [product management](../management/product-management.md)

**RFC**
Request for comments. A scalable method to get feedback on an idea.

**North Star Goal**
A high-level, long-term goal that is used to show the direction to work towards. It should still specific and measurable. It may be complemented by shorter-term metrics.

- Ideally this metric is consistent with your definition of success.
- Ideally this metric is clear to the whole organization, such that they can align.

**Output, Outcome and Impact**
See [requirements engineering](../management/requirements-engineering.md).
