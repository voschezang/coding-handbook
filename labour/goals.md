## Overview

Goals are the expected results of efforts. They may be specific, measurable, achievable, relevant and time/scope bound ([SMART](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria)). Goals may originate from either:

- Core values. These are continuous and may be perpetual. They guide the creation of goals.
- Desires. Opportunities and problems.
- Higher-level objectives. These are more abstract.

One can start an initiative to approach or reach goals.

## Function

Goals are a tools that can be used in several ways. E.g. inspire groups or focus efforts.

|      | Core                              | Performance            |
| ---- | --------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| ⭐    | Align on a direction (north star) | Focus performance      |
| 💡    | Inspire                           | Amplify performance    |
| ⚡    | Energize                          | Invite performance     |
| 🔦    | Enlighten                         | Understand performance |
| 🚦    | Warn                              | Assess performance     |

Goals can originate from

- A problem
- An opportunity

Goals can be

- Static. Set quality standards. E.g. production quota.
- Dynamic. Invite change.

Goals can be formulated as

- (Quota) targets or metrics.
- Stories that relate to a (human) subject and some outcome.

## Planning

Different modes of planning:

- **Top-down**. Follow a vision. Then fill in the remaining steps. Address any obstacle.
  - 🧭 Goal-oriented. Define a clear direction or **outcome**.
    - 🎲 Then work on **positioning** and make bets that will help to achieve your goals.
  - 🎯 Optimize for **point estimates**. Breakdown tasks into concrete sub-tasks. Focus on output.
- **Bottom-up**. Focus on needs. Understand the current problems. Then address them. E.g. remove bottlenecks.

The ideal type of planning depends on the environment. In many contexts, the steps that are required to reach an objective are not intuitive.

## Types of goals

Goals do not have to be *coupled* to plans

- They can be higher level and longer term.
- They can point to an ideal state, without requiring an explicit pre-determined path to get there.

**Idealistic** goals. Decouple long-term goals from plans. Direction > position.

- This improves agility. More flexibility to add initiatives that will bring you closer to a goal.
- This avoids premature optimization. First define where you want to go, before considering the limitations.

**Realistic** goals. Couple short term goals with a planning. Make them [s.m.a.r.t.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria).

- Make them realistic. Minimize scope and contain risk. Consider the available resources.
- Make them time-bound. Ensure there is enough urgency.

## Formulating Goals

> Think big, work small

Criteria for good goals.

- Motivation and incentives. Think big.
  - Outcome > problem. Focus on where to go, rather than what to avoid.
  - Chain outcomes together. Show what the current objective will make possible.
- Make it realistic. Minimize scope.
  - Restrict the outcome to what is in your control.
  - Make it specific. Add conditions. Define when the goal is achieved.
  - Consider the available resources.

In addition, ensure the following.

- High awareness of the main goal, at multiple levels and time scales.
- Urgency. E.g. by committing to deadlines.

**Dimensions**

Inspired by [John](https://twitter.com/johncutlefish/status/1653114991527198720).

- Time-horizon. E.g. days, weeks, months, years, decades.
- Distance to customer. Oriented towards internal tools, platforms, teams, end-users, customers.
- Depth. E.g.
  - Level of abstraction: conceptual or concrete (actionable).
  - Level of detail: generic (visionary) or specific.
  - Strictness: Guiding or focussed.
  - Scope: Broad (holistic) or narrow.

**Anti-patterns**

- Give all goals the same priority. Lack of an preeminent goal.
- Low awareness of the goal. The goal get's lost in day to day activities.
- Lack of repetition and iteration. Switching directions without learning from past results.
- Goals are create purely top-down. There is no consideration for local problems.
- Goals are create purely bottom-up. It is biased to local optimization.
- "Do the same as last year, but more efficient".

## Formulating a Goal

Goals can be used to both motivate and guide a person or organization.

The goal itself should be skewed towards the *Why* instead of the *What*. It should be an optimistic vision or mission.

- This includes a understanding of the relevant assumptions.
- Goals that are too optimistic lead tend to lead to short term optimization. E.g. trying to survive instead of investing in long-term solutions.
- Goal that are not challenging enough lack a motivational effect. This may lead to a lack of focus.

A goal may be accompanied with an *initiative* (input), *target* (output, result) and a *target condition* (objective, outcome) and an estimation of the *impact*.

**Initiative & Target**

Global optima are usually unknown in advance.

- Initially the target condition can be be a vague *challenge*. Missing details can be filled step by step, after reflection and experimentation. In fact, it is inevitable that you find new information when moving forward.
- Define the minimum amount of work that is required to reach an outcome and start there.

- Beware of changing the target condition to fit the current state.

**Metrics**

Use metrics as a tool to track incremental progress. Expectations for metrics should be ambitious but not impossible.

- Note that all metrics are flawed. They cannot be both generic and specific.
- Optimize targets and not [the measure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law) (avoid [perverse incientives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perverse_incentive)).

- Use different goals per timescale: `days, weeks, months, years, decades`. Relate shorter term goals to longer term goals.

**Estimation**

Reasoning with probabilities and large numbers is harder than reasoning with small, discrete numbers

- `1 out of 8` is more intuitive than `12.5%`.
- Conglomerations are easier than continua and numeric values.

- Predict complexity of a tasks by the estimating the number of subtasks

Avoid personal bias. Instead of estimating your personal work (or your team), estimate what an other or similar person/team could achieve.

**Flow of Work**

The optimal size of batches, number of batching steps and the size of subtasks is context-dependent. Hence it should be optimized to current conditions, in concurrence with any target conditions.

**Choosing Goals**

Prioritization requires de-prioritization. This is inherently difficult. A few tools that can be used are:

- Select a single goal, that is absolutely necessary. E.g. address (or identify) the main constraint.

- Create a plot of the benefits as result of the effort required, for each possible goal.

Defining goals

- Bottom-up: First list features or desires, then define metrics.
- Top-down: Define a desired outcome, then define metrics to track progress towards that outcome, then list immediate actions.

**Assumptions & Facts**

For each goal, denote the assumptions and rationale. Be explicit in what's an assumption or uncertain.

## Models

Mindset

- Align on a long-term vision and commit to short term objectives.

| Model                | Optimizes for | Ideal Time horizon |
| -------------------- | ------------- | ------------------ |
| Bounded Optimization | Delivery      | Weeks              |
| North Star Model     | Alignment     | Years              |
| OKR Model            | Focus         | Months             |

### Bounded Optimization

Set static goals to ensure a minimum standard of quality. Then optimize value within those bounds.

1. **Static** goals. Minimal quality standards. Guard rails, rather than quality layers. Standard operations and maintenance.
2. **Dynamic** goals. Change. These can require static goals to be adapted.

### North Star Model

1. North star **goal**. An amazing outcome - yet far away.
2. North star **metric**. A proxy to measure progress. E.g. daily active users, weekly viewing hours.
3. **Current state**. Where you are now.
4. Next **target state(s)**. The <u>path</u> you want to take. Avoid a strict ordering, but do include a preference based on current circumstances.
5. **Initiatives** that will bring you to the next target state.

### OKR Model

> When I go forwards you go backwards - and somewhere we will meet.

OKRs separate qualitative motivational goals from tangible goals. OKRs can be defined per product and target market, but also on an individual level.

**Mission**
Why does this organization exist. A *persistent*, long term goal.

**Objective**
That <u>what you want</u> to achieve in the next quarter or year. A time-bound, *qualitative* goal that is ambitious, inspirational and motivational.

- (for projects) A target state that differs from the current state.
- This can be an hypothesis.

**Key Results**
<u>How you know</u> that you are achieving the objective. *Quantitative* goals that are [measurable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria). These are results of actions that you might take, not the actions themselves.

- They should be so optimistic that only 2/3 of them will be reached.

- These may be time-based. E.g. the churn-rate at a given date.
- (for projects) Target conditions that need to be satisfied in order to reach the target state.

Assign a confidence score to each key result track progress.

**Initiative**
An action that will bring you closer to a result. These should be flexible, in order to be able to respond to surprises.

- E.g. steps that can be taken in sequence to reach target states.

**Risks**
Similar to [MBO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Management_by_objectives), there is a risk of optimizing for metrics (proxies), instead than targets. This is countered by choosing new metrics (KRs) periodically and chaining them to qualitative objectives.

**Health Indicators**
Perpetual objectives or metrics that are kept stable. Any change induced by the current set OKRs should not degrade these.

#### Guide

How to design OKRs, given an initial idea.

1. Exploration
    1. Define the problem space and the desired state.
    2. List realistic and unrealistic goals.
    3. List potential initiatives that are realistic
2. Exploitation
    1. Narrow down the objective.
    2. Deconstruct the desired state into key results.
