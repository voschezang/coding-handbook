# Initiatives

An initiative is a project that is focussed on an outcome. It emphasizes value over minimizing resources or cost.

## Overview

Change requires the selection of an *objective* and an *initiative* to achieve it. This requires alignment with stakeholders and gathering of resources.

> willingness to change = current risk + opportunity - uncertainty - cost of initiative

The initiative is meant to move from a *current stateI* to a *target state*. This requires a transcendence of [inertia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton's_laws_of_motion) - otherwise there would be no need for the initiative at all. The transcendence is made possible by [consuming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_law_of_thermodynamics) *resources*. The promise of change may or may not be enough to obtain these.

Choosing the right objective and initiatives is a challenge in itself. See [goals](../management/goals-planning-strategy.md).

## Templates

Note that inititative are not about requirements. Rather, they are about shared understanding.

### Title Template

Start with the change. From the perspective of a developer or a user.

> As `role` I want `functionality` so that `value`.

> As `persona` I want `action` because `benefit`.

Optionally give context:

> which helps to reach `impact`.

> based on this `fact`, this `assumption` and this `belief`.

### Basic Template

Core information.

| Section | Explanation                                                  |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Why     | The objective                                                |
| What    | The expected changes (results) that will bring the objective closer |
| Who     | The person or group that will benefit from this              |

Additional infromation. How to realize the plan.

| Section | Explanation                                          |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| How     | The actions taken to reach these results             |
| When    | The priority. E.g. in relation to other initiatives. |

### Formal Template

- Core. The objective (expected outcome) and method (deliverables, acceptance criteria).
- Context. The problem, risks, dependencies.

|                         | Purpose                   | Question                                                     |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Objective (goal)**    | Focus, a target           | What do you want to achieve? <br />How does this improve the current situation? <br />How will this help users? |
| **Problem**             | Understanding             | What is the problem with the current situation? <br />For whom? How does this affect them? |
| **Key deliverables**    | Align on expectations     | What valuable results can I expect to see?                   |
| **Acceptence criteria** | Define boundaries         | When is it finished? What are the target conditions?         |
| **Risks**               | Risk management           | What could go wrong?                                         |
| **Dependencies**        | Make assumptions explicit |                                                              |
