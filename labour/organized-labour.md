# Organizing Labour

The organization of labour involves planning, orchestration and execution. This document is a complement to [alignment](../alignment/alignment.md).

[toc]

## Overview

### Alignment & Progress

Consider the following structures. They are ordered by importance, from atomic structures to higher-level structures, each optimizing the whole.

1. **Projects**. Organize increments of work. Work empirically & validate results.
2. **Quality standards**. Organize quality of work.
3. **Processes**. Organize consistency of work.
4. **OKR's**. Organize priorities and scheduling.
5. **Vision**. Keep successive objectives consistent (aligned).
6. **Strategy**. Align strategy within an organization. Re-use solutions across domains.
7. **KPI's**. Summarize performance across organizations.

[Management](../management-principles.md) layers tend to grow together with the number of successive and parallel projects, and the number of contributors. See [teams](../teams/teams.md).

Running an organization ([system](../systems/systems.md)) is a challenge in itself. This too, can be treated as a project. See [organizations](../systems/systems.md).

### Specialization

Scaling alignment requires specialization. One part of the organization focusses on X, freeing up the rest to deal with Y. Specialization has several forms.

- Process steps. Value and production chains.
- [Accountability](../collaboration/accountability.md) & roles.
- [Products](../management/product-management.md). A vehicle to deliver value.

### Organization Structure

- Organization types, scales
- Information flow. [Power structures](../systems/power.md), [leadership styles](../allignment/leadership-styles.md).
- [Lifecycle](systems/lifecycle.md)

## Projects

Projects refer to change. Developing a product or feature, orchestrating an initiative or migration. See A [project](../legacy/project-management.md).

Projects can be categorized based on the evolution of their solution. Initially, a new solution needs to be validated. This relies on prototyping, pilots and pivotting. Eventually, once a market fit is found, the solution needs to be developed. This bounds the complexity of the work, yet it's still requires innovation. Finally, after a solution has been applied routinely, it can be executed with high precision. See [agile](../software-engineering/agile.md).

| Type                    | Complexity       |
| ----------------------- | ---------------- |
| **Validate** a solution | Unknown unknowns |
| **Develop** a solution  | Known unknowns   |
| **Execute** a solution  | Known knowns     |

A project specification can be made as formal and thorough as desired. See [requirements](project-requirements.md). Regardles, all projects should include the following:

1. ðŸ“‹ A project **definition**. A title and abstract. An understanding of:
   1. *What is going to change? How?*
   2. *Who will benefit? How?*
   3. *Whatâ€™s the risk / uncertainty?*
2. â›³ Expected **milestones**. Incremental deliverables. See [increments](increments.md).
   1. *Product* milestones. Valuable to customers / partners
   2. *Learning* milestones. These improve positioning: your ability to deliver value. What you will achieve in between product increments.
3. ðŸ“… **Check-in** intervals. For team members themselves and for stakeholders. The frequency depends on the domain. E.g.:
   1. Evaluate when finished, at date X.
   2. Weekly standup, focussed on milestones or impediments.
4. ðŸ“ˆ **Metrics** that track progress early & accurately. Combine leading and lagging indicators. E.g. MTTR, activations, retention, profit.

These provide accountability and predictability. Verbal agreement can be sufficient, but shared documents will provide a more reliable source of truth. In either case there should be a decent level of [trust](../collaboration/trust.md) in all parties involved. If there's no consensus, it's inevitable that people will disagree about the project's success, or who was responsible for it.

### Project Labour

Labour can be categorized as follows. Based on [environments](https://cynefin.io/wiki/Cynefin), ranging from `chaotic-complex-complicated-obvious`.

It may have the following forms:

1. Research (theoretical, experimental), deconstruct the application domain.
2. Development: novelty, effectiveness, build/improve an application. I.e. invest and introduce change.
3. Operations: efficiency & quality, run a black-box application. I.e. cut cost and block change. Execute a process.
4. Administration: consistency, manage a black-box application. Audit an executed process.

*Management* of labour usually falls under operations or administration. It differentiates itself from "actual" work by distancing itself from it. E.g. through delegation or orchestration. Paradoxically, management of a system is a contribution to that system.

## Processes

A process aims to standardize work. There is repetition through recurrence and succession. The repetitions aids in optimization, improving reliability and speed.

Common processes

- Value & production chains.
- Recurring ceremonies. E.g. daily standups, weekly demoâ€™s, quarterly reviews.
- Meeting agenda's.
- Presentation outlines.



A minimal production chain consists of the following steps.

1. The production process.
2. The product of the production process.
3. The value created by delivering the product to customers.
