# Organizing Labour

This document explores the organization of labour. It considers rigourous processes for learning and managing work.



Consider the following structures. They are ordered by importance, from actual contribution to management.

1. **Projects**. Organize increments of work. Work empirically & validate results.
2. **Quality standards**. Organize quality of work.
3. **OKR's**. Organize priorities and scheduling.
4. **Vision**. Keep successive objectives consistent (aligned).
5. **Strategy**. Align strategy within an organization. Re-use solutions across domains.
6. **KPI's**. Summarize performance across organizations.



## Projects

Projects refer to change. Developing a product or feature, orchestrating an initiative or migration.

Projects can be categorized based on the evolution of their solution. Initially, a new solution needs to be validated. This relies on prototyping, pilots and pivotting. Eventually, once a market fit is found, the solution needs to be developed. This bounds the complexity of the work, yet it's still requires innovation. Finally, after a solution has been applied routinely, it can be executed with high precision.

| Type                    | Complexity       |
| ----------------------- | ---------------- |
| **Validate** a solution | Unknown unknowns |
| **Develop** a solution  | Known unknowns   |
| **Execute** a solution  | Known knowns     |



A project specification can be made as formal and thorough as desired. See [requirements](project-requirements.md). Regardles, all projects should include the following.

- ðŸ“‹ A project **definition**. A title and abstract. An understanding of:
  - *What is going to change? How?*
  - *Who will benefit? How?*
  - *Whatâ€™s the risk / uncertainty?*

- â›³ Expected **milestones**. Incremental deliverables.
  - *Product* milestones. Valuable to customers / partners
  - *Learning* milestones. These improve positioning: your ability to deliver value. What you will achieve in between product increments.
- ðŸ“… **Check-in** intervals. For team members themselves and for stakeholders. The frequency depends on the domain. E.g.:
  - Evaluate when finished, at date X
  - Weekly standup, focussed on milestones or impediments
- ðŸ“ˆ **Metrics** that track progress early & accurately. Combine leading and lagging indicators.
  - E.g. MTTR, activations, retention

These provide accountability and predictability. Verbal agreement can be sufficient, but shared documents will provide a more reliable source of truth. In either case there should be a decent level of trust in all parties involved. If there's no consensus, it's inevitable that people will disagree about the project's success, or who was responsible for it.
