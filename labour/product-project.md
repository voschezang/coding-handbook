# Products and Projects

[toc]

## Overview

Mindset:

- **Project** mindset: Finish a pre-defined fixed set of tasks, within constraints. Assume that the environment is understood.
- **Product** mindset: Continuously deliver value to customers.

Note

- In practice, products are improved through multiple small projects.

- Because products are never finished, they cannot be reduced to a static set of requirements. Instead they represent an outcome, which should be conveyed by telling a story or showing a vision.



> Products are never finished, only deprecated.

|                 | Project                             | Product                    |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Purpose**     | Satisfy requirements                | Deliver value to customers |
| **Timing**      | Finish before the deadline          | Continuously, frequently   |
| **Focus**       | Result-oriented                     | Market-oriented            |
| **Constraints** | Time, cost, requirements, resources | Funding                    |



**Project types**

|                 | Standard Projects                      | Agile Projects               |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Why**         | Satisfy requirements before a deadline | Satisfy acceptance criteria  |
| **When**        | Before a deadline                      | Sooner rather than later     |
| **Lens**        | Output                                 | Outcome                      |
| **Constraints** | Time, resources                        | Resources, quality standards |



### Differences

Typical differences between projects and products.

**Projects** *terminate*; either successfully by meeting requirements or by reaching deadline. There is a bias for the short term (the duration of the project) over the long term (after the project).

- Optimize **cost**. Satisfy requirements as fast and efficiently as possible.

    - Build a feature/project/product, then hand it over and move on.

    - Reach the deadline at all cost; strip features or reduce quality if necessary.

**Products** are *continuous*, but may expire (based on alternatives). There is a preference for value and sustainability.

- Maximize **value**, opportunity and viability.
    - Delivering value to customers > resource efficiency.

- Compatible with DevOps and vertical integration.
    - "You build it, you own, you run it"

- Place bets on potential wins. Prefer outcomes over meeting (initial) requirements.
    - Long-term revenue stream > quarterly results.

Projects typically have three constraints: a time bound, cost bound and a set of requirements (input or output). When risks materialize then at least one of these must be let go.



## Terminology

A *Product* is a proxy for the set of [products](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(business)) and [services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_(economics)) that are used by a *user* and paid for by a *customer*. The *stakeholder* supports the products and aims to eventually profit it, either financially or in some other way. The product is usually build and delivered by employees of an organization. The product is optimized for a target market, but can also be delivered to a boundary market.

Following this terminology, a successful product would need to fulfill the desires of customers, users, stakeholders and employees. It results in:

1. Delivery: Provide value to users, based on a production process.
2. Transaction: Sell to customers.



**Product Discovery**
Deciding what to build, for whom, when.

**Product Delivery**
Building it (R&D) and delivering it (ops).

**Product Teams**
A product team is supposed to completely manage a single product. The team is autonomous and can take ownership, because it controls the [whole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_integration) value chain. See [this template](../documentation.md#Templates).

**Positioning**
Deliver some value to a well-defined set of customers, i.e. a target market.

**Interface**
E.g. a GUI, CLI or API. Any interface has to consider the *user*, the *content* shown to the user, and the *context* in which it is shown.



### Types of Products

- Traditional Product: a static object. Must be right the first time.
- "Software" Product: can be updated (patched) after the first release.
- Service: completely continuous. Regularly updated to market conditions.



### Levels of product

- A commodity, a heterogenous product. Marketed by showing features or generic benefits.
- A unique selling point. Solving a specific problem, for a specific market/persona.
- Being a brand. An identity/lifestyle. Telling a story.
