# Products, Projects and Initiatives

A product is a vehicle to deliver value. A project is a plan that aims to fullfill a set of requirements. An initiative is a program to address a problem or opportunity.

## Overview

Mindset:

- **Project** mindset: Finish a pre-defined fixed set of tasks, within constraints.
- **Product** mindset: Continuously deliver value to customers.

In practice, products are improved through multiple small projects or initiatives.



>  Products are never finished, only deprecated.

Because products are never finished, they cannot be reduced to a static set of requirements. Instead they represent an outcome, which should be conveyed by telling a story or showing a vision.



**Initiatives** are projects without deadlines. Instead, they have domain-specific acceptance criteria. Sizing may be controlled through hierarchy. E.g. sagas, epics, stories and tasks.

|                 | Product                    | Project                             | Initiative                   |
| --------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Purpose**     | Deliver value to customers | Satisfy requirements                | Satisfy acceptance criteria  |
| **Timing**      | Continuously, frequently   | Finish before the deadline          | Sooner rather than later     |
| **Focus**       | Market-oriented            | Result-oriented                     | Outcome/impact-oriented      |
| **Constraints** | Funding                    | Time, cost, requirements, resources | Resources, quality standards |



### Differences

Typical differences between projects and products.

**Projects** *terminate*; either successfully by meeting requirements or by reaching deadline. There is a bias for the short term (the duration of the project) over the long term (after the project).

- Optimize **cost**. Satisfy requirements as fast and efficiently as possible.

    - Build a feature/project/product, then hand it over and move on.

    - Reach the deadline at all cost; strip features or reduce quality if necessary.

**Products** are *continuous*, but may expire (based on alternatives). There is a preference for value and sustainability.

- Maximize **value**, opportunity and viability.
    - Delivering value to customers > resource efficiency.

- Compatible with DevOps and vertical integration.
    - "You build it, you own, you run it"

- Place bets on potential wins. Prefer outcomes over meeting (initial) requirements.
    - Long-term revenue stream > quarterly results.

Projects typically have three constraints: a time bound, cost bound and a set of requirements (input or output). When risks materialize then at least one of these must be let go.



### Types of Products

- Traditional Product: a static object. Must be right the first time.
- "Software" Product: can be updated (patched) after the first release.
- Service: completely continuous. Regularly updated to market conditions.



### Levels of product

- A commodity, a heterogenous product. Marketed by showing features or generic benefits.
- A unique selling point. Solving a specific problem, for a specific market/persona.
- Being a brand. An identity/lifestyle. Telling a story.
