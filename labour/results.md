# Results

The aim of projects and initiatives is to achieve results.

## Flow

Value chain. From discovering problems to solving problems.

1. Idea. A new product or feature. Verification of the idea.
2. The development product. An implementation of the idea.
3. Delivery of the product to a set of users.
4. Increase in revenue or growth for the business.

Ideas can be tested. See [bets](./bets.md).



Results can be oriented towards preservation (firefighting), output (feature factory), outcomes or impact.

Results are realized through discovery and delivery.

- [Discovery](discovery.md). Decide what to deliver. Use experiments and prototypes.
- [Delivery](delivery.md). Deliver (develop) it effectively.

## Uncertainty

|                 | ðŸ“¦ Output        | ðŸ‘¤ Outcome | ðŸ“ˆ Impact             |
| --------------- | --------------- | --------- | -------------------- |
| **Factors**     | Time/cost/scope | Behaviour | Environment, markets |
| **Uncertainty** | Low to high     | High      | High                 |
| **Results**     | Fast            | Delayed   | Indirect             |



## Projects

Projects tend to have constraints: time, cost and scope.
