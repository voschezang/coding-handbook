# Learning

## Principles

**Mindset**

- Practice & Repetition. Listening (observing) and reflection.

- Growth mindset. Now you don't know, but you can learn and change.

**Tension-release**
Push & pull. Similar to a dialogue, there should be a two-way interaction. Cross boundaries shortly, then step back and reflect. This allows you to maintain flow.

**Thesis-antithesis-synthesis**
A three-steps pattern. In general, small (fast) cycles are less disruptive.

1. **Thesis**. An idea (eureka) or a revolution. Associated with hype and momentum.
2. **Antithesis**. A conflict. The new way will naturally differ from the old paradigm and will have to be tested to real-word scenario's. There can be resistance from the status quo. Moreover, the existing structures are optimized for the old paradigm. Output is likely to decrease for a while. Change is an investment that might pay off over time.
3. **Synthesis**. A resolution where the new way is incorporated and becomes part of the main paradigm. Side-effect of the original change are resolved.

**Revolution vs. Evolution**
Changes van vary from being large and disruptive, to gradual shifts.

**Consicous competence**

1. *Un*conscious *in*competence
2. Conscious *in*competence
3. Conscious competence
4. *Un*conscious competence

After this, one could go back and zoom in on specific behaviours that can be improved.

- Unlearning: from 4. to 2.
- Relearning: from 2. to 4.

## Practice (Context)

### Organizations & Processes

The ideal learning strategy depends on the  [environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynefin_framework). See [domains](systems/organization-structure.md#Autonomy%20and%20Alignment%20per%20Domain).

- Chaotic: act-sense-respond
- Complex: probe-sense-respond
- Complicated: sense-analyse-respond
- Obvious: sense-categorise-respond

### Learning

Other patterns

- plan-do-check-act
- imitate-assimilate-innovate
- inspect-adapt-reflect
- visualize-stabilize-optimize

## Organizational Learning

An optimal learning environment has:

- A teacher/coach/facilitator
- Other learners
- Customer or real-world feedback

Learning requires both theory and practice (experimentation). Making mistakes is a vital part of learning.

- Prefer collaboration over competition. The latter discourages mistakes, and thus hampers learning.

Learning on a local level is easy, but learning at the "middle management level" is not (e.g. due to competition, fear of failure).

Local improvements and adaptation are a vital complement to top-down strategies.

- This requires alignment on all levels. Hence higher management should share their vision and strategy within the organization.
- Local improvements are usually easier than global ones.

### Improvement Frameworks

A few dimensions:

- Top-down or bottom-up.
- Invite or inflict change.
- Revolutionary or evolutionary change.

#### Scrum

See [srcum](scrum-guide.md). Inspect-Adapt-Reflect.

#### Kanban

Visualize-Stabilize-Optimize. First you have to find the right challenge (e.g. the bottleneck). Second you have to find stability, otherwise you cannot reliably control it. Only then you can start to optimize.

- The long-term version of this is [PDCA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDCA).

#### Agile

Context: uncertain, ever-changing environments. IT can never be fast enough.

1. Formalize work. Make it explicit. Vizualize it.
2. Focus. Manage flow by managing WIP.
3. Feedback loops. Relate performance to some goal or outcome.
4. Reflect & Improve. Iterate.

#### DevOps

3-step improvement process

#### Lean

Principles

1. Focus on customer value
2. Identify value stream, from concept to cash
3. Flow, minimize lead time, flow efficiency
4. Pull, donâ€™t over produce
5. Strive for perfection, high quality.  This is mostly for *complicated* rather than *complex* domains

## Learning Models

[Dreyfus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreyfus_model_of_skill_acquisition) model combined with the [conscious competence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_stages_of_competence) model.

| Novice                       | Advanced Beginner                                    | Competence                                  | Proficient                                | Expert                                    |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| *Un*conscious *in*competence | Conscious *in*competence                             | Conscious competence                        | *Un*conscious competence                  | Transcended                               |
| ...                          | Recollection: Situational instead of non-Situational | Recognition: Holistic instead of decomposed | Decision: Intuitive instead of analytical | Awareness: Absorbed instead of monitoring |
| Needs rules                  | Tests rules                                          | Applies rules                               | Falls back on rules                       | Transcends rules                          |

> follow rules - break rules - make rules

**[Dreyfus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreyfus_model_of_skill_acquisition) model**

| Skill Level/ Mental Function | Novice          | Advanced Beginner | Competence | Proficient | Expert   |
| ---------------------------- | --------------- | ----------------- | ---------- | ---------- | -------- |
| **Recollection**             | Non-Situational | Situational       |            |            |          |
| **Recognition**              | Decomposed      |                   | Holistic   |            |          |
| **Decision**                 | Analytical      |                   |            | Intuitive  |          |
| **Awareness**                | Monitoring      |                   |            |            | Absorbed |

**[Shuhari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuhari) model**

1. Obey. Follow traditions, learn fundamentals, heuristics, proverbs.
2. Digress. Break with tradition.
3. Separate, transcendence. Exceed tradition. Find new ways

**Teaching models - roles**
