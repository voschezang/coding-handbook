# Learning

[toc]

## Principles

**Mindset**

- Practice & Repetition. Listening (observing) and reflection.

- Growth mindset. Now you don't know, but you can learn and change.



**Tension-release**
Push & pull. Similar to a dialogue, there should be a two-way interaction. Cross boundaries shortly, then step back and reflect. This allows you to maintain flow.



**Thesis-antithesis-synthesis**
A three-steps pattern. In general, small (fast) cycles are less disruptive.

1. **Thesis**. An idea (eureka) or a revolution. Associated with hype and momentum.
2. **Antithesis**. A conflict. The new way will naturally differ from the old paradigm and will have to be tested to real-word scenario's. There can be resistance from the status quo. Moreover, the existing structures are optimized for the old paradigm. Output is likely to decrease for a while. Change is an investment that might pay off over time. 
3. **Synthesis**. A resolution where the new way is incorporated and becomes part of the main paradigm. Side-effect of the original change are resolved.



**Revolution vs. Evolution**
Changes van vary from being large and disruptive, to gradual shifts. 



## Practice (Context)

#### Organizations & Processes

The ideal learning strategy depends on the  [environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynefin_framework). See [domains](organization-structure.md#Autonomy%20and%20Alignment%20per%20Domain).

- Chaotic: act-sense-respond
- Complex: probe-sense-respond
- Complicated: sense-analyse-respond
- Obvious: sense-categorise-respond

#### Learning

Other patterns

- plan-do-check-act
- imitate-assimilate-innovate
- inspect-adapt-reflect
- visualize-stabilize-optimize





## Organizational Learning

An optimal learning environment has:

- A teacher/coach/facilitator
- Other learners
- Customer or real-world feedback

Learning requires both theory and practice (experimentation). Making mistakes is a vital part of learning.

- Prefer collaboration over competition. The latter discourages mistakes, and thus hampers learning.

Learning on a local level is easy, but learning at the "middle management level" is not (e.g. due to competition, fear of failure).



Local improvements and adaptation are a vital complement to top-down strategies.

- This requires alignment on all levels. Hence higher management should share their vision and strategy within the organization.
- Local improvements are usually easier than global ones.



### Improvement Frameworks

A few dimensions:

- Top-down or bottom-up.
- Invite or inflict change.
- Revolutionary or evolutionary change.

#### Scrum

See [srcum](scrum-guide.md). Inspect-Adapt-Reflect.

#### Kanban

Visualize-Stabilize-Optimize. First you have to find the right challenge (e.g. the bottleneck). Second you have to find stability, otherwise you cannot reliably control it. Only then you can start to optimize.

- The long-term version of this is [PDCA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDCA).



#### DevOps

3-step improvement process

#### Lean

Principles

1. Focus on customer value
2. Identify value stream, from concept to cash
3. Flow, minimize lead time, flow efficiency
4. Pull, donâ€™t over produce
5. Strive for perfection, high quality.  This is mostly for *complicated* rather than *complex* domains







## Learning Models

[Dreyfus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreyfus_model_of_skill_acquisition) model combined with the [conscious competence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_stages_of_competence) model.

| Novice                       | Advanced Beginner                                    | Competence                                  | Proficient                                | Expert                                    |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| *Un*conscious *in*competence | Conscious *in*competence                             | Conscious competence                        | *Un*conscious competence                  | Transcended                               |
| ...                          | Recollection: Situational instead of non-Situational | Recognition: Holistic instead of decomposed | Decision: Intuitive instead of analytical | Awareness: Absorbed instead of monitoring |
| Needs rules                  | Tests rules                                          | Applies rules                               | Falls back on rules                       | Transcends rules                          |

>  follow rules - break rules - make rules

**[Shuhari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuhari) model**

1. Obey. Follow traditions, learn fundamentals, heuristics, proverbs.
2. Digress. Break with tradition.
3. Separate, transcendence. Exceed tradition. Find new ways
