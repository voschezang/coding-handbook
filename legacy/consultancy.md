# Consultancy



**Delivery**

Problem solving...



**Relevance**

> If you talk really well about X, people think you're really good at X.

Consultancy involves storytelling, justification and expectation management. Align with your partners. Understand their needs. Show the relevance.

- Use formal language to describe the outcome. This makes activity sound professional.
- Emphasis may be skewed towards feasibility, viability or desirability. Optimize the wrong metric is a waste.
