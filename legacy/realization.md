# Realization

Visions are *realized* through discovery and delivery.

## Overview

> May our dreams become our plans

Discovery and delivery are about realizing a vision.

- [Discovery](../labour/discovery.md) focusses on learning what to deliver. It involves planning, experimentation and using prototypes.
- Delivery aims to realize the resulting plans.

The two phases re-occur at various scales and phases in a product lifecycle.

At **product** level.

- Product discovery. Phases within the lifecycle of a product.
- Product delivery. Intermediate deliverables within a project or initiative.

At **planning** level. For individual initiatives and projects.

- Discovery phase. *What to build?*
- Delivery phase. *How to build it?*

Realization can happen in increments. Strategies typically optimize for efficiency or predictability. The former takes risk by building large increments. The latter minimizes risk by testing early. See [increments](../labour/increments).

**Effectiveness**

Value delivery can be done effectively, efficiently and predictably.

## Value Chain

See value-chain.md

## Vision

Concrete ideas tend to originate from underlying desires.

- Organizations have an **identity** and associated values. *"Who are we?"*
- A **mission** is existential. *"Why does this organization exist?"*
- A **vision** is an alternative to the current reality. *"What future do we envision?"*
