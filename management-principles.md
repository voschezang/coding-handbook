## Overview

> Good management is situational

Management *an sich* is a theoretical domain. In the real world, one would encounter management of a *subject*. For example: management of a project or a department.

This *subject* can be framed as a [theoretical system](systems-management.md). The purpose of a manager is to ensure that the system achieves it purpose - both now and in the future. A prerequisite for this is ensuring the quality and availability of the system's resources. The performance of a manager is interconnected with the performance of a system.

At minimum, management involves alignment, communication, facilitation, orchestration and prioritization. Depending on the scale of the subject, a manager may also contribute in secondary tasks such as planning, execution and coaching. Hence the role of a manager may extend from facilitator to director.

Management consists of **balances**. For example:

- Learning and adjusting.
  - Being adaptive (pragmatic) or being consistent (conservative) and making use of experience. Based on the environment.
- Focussing and diversifying.
  - E.g. improving a process versus outsourcing a process.
- Time horizon.
  - Pursue an optimistic ideal or a realistic planning.
  - Optimizing for the next quarter or for multiple decades.
- Delegating much but not everything.

See also [organization-structure](organization-structure.md) and [systems-management](systems-management.md).



**Properties**

1. At an abstract level, management lies between the roles of an *administrator* and an *operator*. The latter requires a higher level of domain knowledge.
2. Type of leadership. The role can vary from being a *leader* to a *facilitator*.
3. The nature of the target: *projects* or *processes*. The former focusses on reaching a goal within a time or cost bound. The latter is focusses on maximizing value.
    1. Project (time- and cost-bound). Focus on reaching a goal, completing requirements.
    2. Process (bound by opportunity cost). Focus on maximizing value (often profit). E.g. management of [products](product-management.md) or people.

There is a tradeoff between adapting to the current team, and seeking out employees that accept a certain management style.



**Activities**

1. Set *optimistic* goals, prioritize them and make a *realistic* planning/estimation.
    - Be great at setting expectations (e.g. to stakeholders).
    - Communicate a clear vision.
    - Adapt over time. Revisit past decisions.
    - Decide what [*not*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost) to do.
2. Creating an environment where employees can reach those goals.

    - Employees should have agency and be incentivized to be pro-active. Allow them to question everything.
    - The organization should be a community, where people interact.
3. Ensuring the availability of resources (incl. in the future).



### Performance

See [systems-management](systems-management.md).



**Effectiveness**

The two main directions to be effective are:

- Deliver (maximize) value to customer. This may require investment and innovation (change).
- Eliminate (minimize) waste. This doesn't just demand reliability and stability, but it also requires an investment to remove obstacles.
  - Waste is defined as "anything that isn't part of the value chain"

This involves

- Continuous improvement of purposes, people, processes.
- Continuous discovery of value and waste.

Note that investment involves a short term cost by definition.

**Measure of Success**

Define a proper measure of success. Evaluate whether the assignment could be successful (outcome-based) without meeting the requirements.

Typical components:

- Total returns. Delivered value - rather than produced value. E.g.
  - Profit minus expenses and inventory.
  - Quality: high quality and low variance.

- Relative returns. Delivered value relative to the effort or cost put into the system.
  - Efficiency: of the system as a whole or individual components (e.g. resources). This consists of resource utilization and throughput.

- Agility: be able to adapt. Typical influences are lead time, batch sizes.
    - E.g. minimize the cost of change.


Note that measures of success can be biased by how a component is perceived. E.g. a cost center of a profit center.

- Cost world: make local improvements (cut costs), that add up linearly to a global optimum.
- Throughput: focus on the weakest link in the critical chain.

Timeline, scope and capacity are related. If one changes, then at least one of the others will too.

### Change

Note that these can all involve [*change*](learning.md). A typical challenge is to change processes that are optimized for the status quo. See also [organizational culture](organization-structure.md).

1. [Influence](https://danluu.com/culture/) people (indirect)
    1. Incentives. Rewards and punishments for behaviour or achievements.
    2. Processes. E.g. regulation, validation.
    3. Culture. "inherent" values. E.g. ideals to strive for.
2. Persuade people (direct). E.g. [transformational leadership](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformational_leadership).

**Dimensions of Change**

Reaching goals usually requires change.

1. Direction.
    1. Increase positive effects (e.g. increase profit).
    2. Decrease negative effects (e.g. cut cost).
2. Locality.
    1. Optimize (all) individual components.
        1. Risk: over-production, tunnel-vision, high inventory that can become obsolete.
    2. Optimize the flow of tasks through the system. E.g. manage constraints. Note that this can include worsening the performance of specific components.
        1. Risk: bias for the current goal. E.g. bias for a target market.
    3. Diversify. E.g. diversify the product line for exposure to new markets.
        1. Diversify into new markets.
            1. Risk: lack of focus, lack of efficiency, low margins.
        2. Diversify the current market by creating [segments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_segmentation).

With this in mind, three questions can be asked: What to change? What to change it to? How to do it?

Also see [goals and strategy](goals-planning-strategy.md).

## Collaboration

**Focus**

Reaching consensus on what *needs* to be done is easier than reaching consensus on what *can* be done.

Determine whether a team needs to **adjust** or whether it needs to **change**. Two different approaches can be:

- Use ceremonies & tools for team alignment (i.e. slight adjustment), until the desired behaviour or culture has been reached.
- Apply the concept of a "fresh start" whenever you want to change or disrupt the current way of working. E.g. formulate former practices or habits as something the "old" team would do, and the new practice as something you would do from now on.

Make sure there is regular reflection, both on the level of individuals and the level of teams.

Make goals and problems **visible**. E.g. using Scrum or Kanban boards, milestones, dashboards, alerts, red/green builds. This incentivizes attention and reflection (and re-think our approach).

**Role Assignment**

There exist multiple models for [role and responsibility assignment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsibility_assignment_matrix). A few fundamental roles:

- Accountable for the end-result.
- Responsible for execution.
- Consulted. E.g. providing consultancy or support.
- Informed. Following along.

**Persistence**

One-pagers. One page is enough to introduce an idea but does forces the writer to be concise. In addition they are well-suited for collaboration. Although they are abstract, the corresponding idea should be measurable in order to be effective. See [planning](goals-planning-strategy.md).

**Team Performance**

Based on the Lencioni model (Five dysfunctions of a team):

1. Level of **trust**. Can team members be open/vulnerable?
2. Acknowledgement and resolution of **conflict**. Is conflict suppressed? How long does it take for issues to appear?
3. Level of **commitment** and dedication.
4. Acceptance and avoidance of **accountability**. Do team members hold each other accountable? Is the team being held accountable?
5. (In)attention to - collective - **results**. Do collective goals corresponds to personal goals?



### Meetings

> Lack of conflict is an indicator that the right topics aren't being addressed.

A lack of **consensus** is normal, especially for complex topics. First put all the cards on the table, have an open discussion and consider all relevant arguments. Then let the *chair* make a decision.

Best practices

- Scope
  - Make meetings specific. Limit their scope. Don't strive for a one size fits all.
    - E.g. status checks, retrospectives, reviews and demos (either internally or public).
  - Insect the relevance of meetings. Connect them to the actual business, e.g. using KPIs.
  - Save out-of-scope topics for later. This avoids the problem of not taking enough time for them. They also require a context shift and this reduce focus
- Structure
  - Use an agenda for meetings that should be prepared beforehand.
    - This allows participants to evaluate whether each particular meeting is relevant to them.
  - Topics based on current priority are better than following an outdated agenda
  - A good structure doesnâ€™t require agenda. E.g. a 1 min. round of updates doesn't require an agenda.
- Schedule time to do preparation and post-preparation.
  - This should be roughly proportional the length of the meeting and the number of participants.

See also [goals-planning-strategy](goals-planning-strategy.md#Meetings).

### Departments

Traditional conflicts between departments

**Development & Operations**

- Development wants to change and innovate
- Operations wants stability and predictability

Typical solutions: DevOps, product-teams.

**Operations & Sales**

- Operations prefers small changes over large ones (e.g. slow supply lines).
- Sales prefers bulk orders due to costs

Typical solutions: ship orders in increments, vertical integration, store resources in a central location

## Management per Type

**Organization Management**
 [organization-structure](organization-structure.md)

**Crisis management**

- Dealing with risk after they've materialized.



**Stakeholder management (managing up)**

> Ask for advice, not for feedback

In general, this involves: organizing, monitoring, improving interactions and relations with stakeholders.

Specifically:

- Discovering who your stakeholders are. Evaluating their relative importance. E.g. based on urgency, power and legitimacy.
- Discovering the needs of these stakeholders. Evaluate these needs based on relevance.
- Communicate expectations to these stakeholders.



Ascertain:

- Their goals, their expectations
- How they want to be kept in the loop
- Be transparent. Share challenges.



Communication - based on a request:

1. Send acknowledgement
2. Send planning. E.g. the estimated date of the change.
4. Confirm success - after the change has been done.





**Expectation management**

- Under-promise (and over-deliver) to stakeholders. Avoid uncertainty and build trust.
  - Focus on *long-term*, abstract goals. Rely on *minimal* requirements.
  - Add in slack as a buffer against risks.

- Over-promise internally, in order to motivate employees.
  - Include a *short-term* planning, that is specific. Include *full* requirements.
  - In addition, prefer learning over blaming.

Technique:

1. What do you expect?
2. This is what you can expect. This is what we will do.



**Time management**

Let the other accept your schedule. Not everything is possible, so force the client to choose explicitly. Communicate transparently.

There is never enough time, but there are three ways to manage it: prioritization, efficiency and multiplication.

Prioritize *core* activities and defer, drop or delegate (outsource) *contextual* activities.

Sometimes efficiency can be improved by changing processes or technology.

Time can be multiplied.

- Teach others *why* and *what* instead of *how*. Empower others to do it independently.
- Broadcasting instead of point-to-point communication. E.g. write a blog post or wiki instead of a long email.

### Process Management

Based on the properties of [systems](systems-management.md) the following steps can be derived. See also [TOC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_constraints).

1. Identify the main constraint in the system.
    1. Identify the [critical chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_path_method).
    2. Identify the critical component. This can be either a policy or a physical constraint.
2. Assuming there is no simple solution, *exploit* the constraint. Ensure that the resource is used for the right job and then maximize its throughput.
3. *Subordinate* everything else. Let dependent components run at partial capacity. This avoids wasteful over-production.
4. *Elevate* the constraint. E.g. increase the capacity of the critical components.
5. Repeat all the previous steps, until the constraint has moved *outside* of the system. Note that lifting a bottleneck may change the functioning of the whole system.
6. Two remaining challenges are:
    1. [Risk management](#Risk Management). E.g. finding optimal buffer-sizes.
    2. [Product management](product-management.md). Adjust the target market. E.g. increase diversification or market segmentation.

### Risk Management

Definitions:

- Risk: a future undesirable event and events that precede it.

- Risk management: dealing with unpleasantness, instead of counting on luck.

```
Total Risk = threads (external) + vulnerabilities (internal)
```

The main *prerequisite* is a certain corporate culture: Thinking in probabilities & decriminalize risk. Uncertainty should be preferred over being wrong (or overly optimistic).

- Prefer mean-variance optimization over point-estimates. A typical prediction should include (un)certainty bounds. E.g. "We need at least 4 months, and it may take up to 1 year (in the worst case). We estimate a 80 % chance of finishing it in 6 to 8 months."
  - Usually point estimate overestimate in order to compensate for uncertainty. This can result in an [increase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_law) in the amount of work

- Express projects success not as an absolute (success or fail), but as progression (number of features delivered at end of time period).
  - Build in slack, i.e. the flexibility to skip/add/change features during the project.

A secondary prerequisite is a list of assumptions. These are (usually show-stopping) risks that are delegated upwards to the employer. This reduces the change of overlooking "unthinkable" risk.

**Types of Strategies**

1. General strategies:
    1. Avoid or limit tail-risk rather than focussing on winning.
    2. Diversify to handle idiosyncratic (unsystematic) risk. I.e. make multiple small bets instead of a single large one.
2. Specific strategies that don't address risk:
    1. Avoidance: don't take risks at all (but miss out on potential wins).
    2. Evasion (retainment): count on luck, assume low-probability events won't occur.
3. Specific strategies that do address risk:
    1. Containment: decrease impact of risk when they do materialize. E.g. reserve *buffers*.*
    2. Mitigation: reduce containment cost. E.g. though insurance. This has an up-front cost, independent of whether the risk will materialize.

*Given a set of independent risks, the risk exposure per risk is the product of the probability of occurrence and the cost of occurrence. A conservative*buffer* is strictly higher then the total exposure.

```
Risk Exposure = probability x materalization cost
```

**Types of Containment Strategies**

- Isolate; use layering.
- Minimize
- Monitor; collect information about the incident and the second-order effects. E.g. uncommon patterns.
- Active Defense

**Types of risks**

- Planning-related:
  - Inherent flaws in the schedule. E.g. an unrealistic, aggressive schedule
  - Requirements inflation; an increase in requirements over the scope of the project.
  - Ambiguity in the specification. Design decision that are deferred until implementation time.
  - Dependencies.
- Employee-related:
  - Employee turnover.
  - Poor productivity. E.g. due to lack of motivation, poor working conditions, problems with communication, collaboration or coordination.
- User-related
  - Usability (user interaction).
- Context-related
  - Adaptability (to new environments). E.g. scaling up.
  - Supply chain / dependencies.

## Miscellaneous

Fundamental characteristics of the world (from [Buddhism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_marks_of_existence)):

1. Change. Nothing is permanent (time moves forward). As a result, systems degrade and expire. Hence there is a need to adapt, transform and sometimes start over. Naturally, even methods itself have to be adapted.
2. [Interdependence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_theory). Consider components and connections. Hence we should embrace collaboration over isolation.
3. Dissatisfaction. Repetition is boring. Hence there is a need to iterate, learn and improve.

In addition, learning (adapting) takes practice. Both at the individual and organizational level.

**Gaining knowledge**

- Start with a prior belief, formulate, collect data (experiment), update your belief, and repeat.
- Value [falsifiability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability).
- Think in probabilities. Absolute certainty should be a red flag.

**Types of work**

> Work needs to be defined before it can be delegated.

There are three types of work.

1. Unplanned work. Firefighting. E.g. incidents, recovery work.
2. Planned work or pre-defined work.
    1. Business projects. E.g. directly related to customer demand.
    2. Internal projects. Enable business projects.
    3. Changes. E.g. maintenance.
3. Planning work. E.g. defining, refining , adjusting or changing plans.

**Knowledge**

Four types of knowledge

- Known knowns: mastery
- Known unknowns: self-awareness
- Unknown knowns: hidden potential
- Unknown unknowns: blind spots

**Stability / Reliability**

Single point estimates (e.g. the mean) are a poor predictor of stability. The following image shows that chaotic (random) and cyclical processes - which are fundamentally different - can have the same mean.
