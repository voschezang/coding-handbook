## Overview

> Good management is situational

See also [organization-structure.md](organization-structure.md). Management consists of **balances**. For example:

- Learning and adjusting.
    - Being adaptive (pragmatic) or being consistent (conservative) and making use of experience.

- Focussing versus diversifying.
    - E.g. improving a process versus outsourcing a process.

- Time horizon.
    - Pursue an optimistic ideal or a realistic planning.
    - Optimizing for the next quarter or for multiple decades.




Three integral properties of management.

1. At an abstract level, management lies between the roles of an *administrator* and an *operator*. The latter requires a higher level of domain knowledge. 
2. Type of leadership. The role can vary from being a *leader* to a *facilitator*.
3. The nature of the target: *projects* or *processes*. The former focusses on reaching a goal within a time or cost bound. The latter is focusses on maximizing value. 
    1. Project (time- and cost-bound). Focus on reaching a goal.
    2. Process (bound by opportunity cost). Focus on maximizing value (often profit). E.g. management of [products](product-management.md) or people.





**Change**

Note that these can all involve *change*. A typical challenge is to change common processes.

1. [Influences](https://danluu.com/culture/) people
    1. Incentives. Rewards and punishments for behaviour or achievements.
    2. Processes. E.g. regulation, validation.
    3. Culture. "inherent" values. E.g. ideals to strive for.
2. Persuade people



Reaching goals usually requires change.

1. Direction.
    1. Increase positive effects (e.g. increase profit).
    2. Decrease negative effects (e.g. cut cost).
2. Locality.
    1. Optimize (all) individual components. 
        1. Risk: over-production, tunnel-vision.
    2. Optimize the flow of tasks through the system. E.g. manage constraints. Note that this can include worsening the performance of specific components. 
        1. Risk: bias for the current goal. E.g. bias for a target market.
    3. Diversify. E.g. diversify the product line for exposure to new markets.
        1. Risk: lack of focus, lack of efficiency, low margins.

With this in mind, three questions can be asked: What to change? What to change it to? How to do it?

Also see  [goals and strategy](goals-planning-strategy.md).



**Type of leadership**

Management consists of two main activities:

1. Set *optimistic* goals, prioritize them and make a *realistic* planning/estimation.
    - Be great at setting expectations.
    - Adapt over time. Revisit past decisions.
    - Prioritization includes deciding what *not* to do.
2. Creating an environment where employees can reach those goals.

    - Employees should have agency and be incentivized to be pro-active. Allow them to question everything.
    - The organization should be a community, where people interact.

Hence management styles can be oriented towards (1) leadership or (2) facilitation. In addition there might be a focus on a specific function, for example a product or project. The work will vary greatly dependent on the type of organization and the composition of teams.

There is a tradeoff between adapting to the current team, and seeking out employees that accept a certain management style.



**Measure of Success**

Define a proper measure of success. Evaluate whether the assignment could be successful (outcome-based) without meeting the requirements. 

Typical components:

- Total total returns. Delivered  value rather than produced value. E.g.
    - Profit minus expenses and inventory.
    - Quality: high quality and low variance.

- Relative returns. Delivered value relative to the effort or cost put into the system. 
    - Efficiency: of the system as a whole or individual components (e.g. resources). This consists of resource utilization and throughput.

- Agility: be able to adapt. Typical influences are lead time, batch sizes

Note that measures of success can be biased by how a component is perceived. E.g. a cost center of a profit center. 



## Systems & Processes

Many challenges in management can be untangled by going back to fundamentals. A general form is a *system*. Using a mathematical representation of a system allows us to draw conclusions that generalize to arbitrary domain.

Anything can be described as a system, but the level of uncertainty and control may vary.

A specific type of system is an *organization*, which can be defined as an interdependent set of components that work together towards a common goal. The alignment, autonomy and coordination of these components complicates the path to the goal.



**Systems & Processes**

Any system can be modeled as a black box with inputs and outputs. Given an objective (e.g. provide value) or a key result (e.g. making money), the progress can be understood using this simplified system:

- *Input*: money moving into the system (over time). E.g. through sales, or services being delivered to customers.
    - This can be defined as *throughput*
- *Output*: operational expenses (over time). The cost to turn inventory into sold products.
- *Inventory*: everything else. This category doesn't (yet) create value.
    - E.g. investments that can be sold or reserves (buffers) that are kept for risk containment.
    - The longer inventory sits idle the lower the relative ROI. This drags down the performance of the whole.
    - Most inventory depreciates over time. Inventory can even become obsolete.
    

Be careful not to make the boundary of the system too small, as it will lead to optimization of local optima.

Using these measurable properties, a universal system-metric would be: `input - output - inventory`. Any choice can be evaluated using this metric: "Is the change going to improve this metric in a given timespan?"

From this definition, it follows that any work that does not contribute towards throughput is either an investment or a complete waste.

> Working on the right thing > investing (e.g. optimizing, learning) > working on the wrong thing (over-producing)

As a complement to this metric, a relative ROI can be defined as: `(input - output) / inventory` (where inventory is never zero). This metric highlights the cost of inventory. Beware that it doesn't include absolute profit. Any comparison will have to be adjusted for scale (e.g. thousands or millions). 

The future profitability can be defined as the [expected value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value) of the first metric: `E[input] - E[output] - E[inventory]`. Naturally, the [risk-adjusted return](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk-adjusted_return_on_capital) is obtained by dividing this metric by the variance (or some other proxy for risk).



**Propagation of errors**

>  A chain is no stronger than its weakest link.

A bottleneck or constraint can greatly impact the product of the system. The typical example of this is traffic congestion. Mathematically speaking, the variance of a system is [equal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bienaym%C3%A9%27s_identity) to the sum of the variance of each individual component and the covariances between them. This means that systems with highly dependent (correlated) components suffer from this.

The only fundamental way to avoid internal bottlenecks is to let the majority of components run at partial capacity; build in slack. This requires a system to have more capacity than market demand, resulting in a a tradeoff between having formation of bottlenecks and resource efficiency.

Note that there can also be an external bottleneck. E.g. market demand that is lower than the capacity of the system.



**Resources**

Let's use the formal term *resource* for components in a system. This includes anything that helps the system or organization towards its goal. Based on this definition, optimizing non-bottleneck components doesn't improve the efficiency of the system. The caveat is that resources should of course also work on the *right* thing. Avoiding working on the wrong thing can reduce waste and thereby improve global efficiency.

Resources can be categorizes as:

1. Bottlenecks: any resource that has capacity â‰¤ than the demand placed upon it.
2. Capacity constraint resources. A resource that is on the verge of becoming a bottleneck.
3. Non-bottlenecks. Optimizing these will not improve the flow of the system.



The first step is to find and [address bottlenecks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_constraints). If they cannot easily be resolved then do the following.

1. Ensure that the resource is used for the right job. This is always important, but sometimes difficult to put into practice.
2. Subordinate nearby resources to the bottleneck resource. Maximize utilization or minimize idle time of the bottleneck resource. This will make it more efficient.
3. Improve the resource itself. Either by
    1. Increasing capacity or efficiency.
    2. Increasing quality. E.g. reduce variance.
4. These changes may have shifted the bottleneck elsewhere. Repeat this process until market demand has become the limiting factor.

It can be concluded that any idle time of non-bottleneck resources is perfectly fine. This can even be preferable over over-production, which will increase inventory.

Tasks that go to bottleneck resources typically have high [queue times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_management_system), while all other tasks have high waiting times.



**Efficiency & Optimization**

> Resource activation does not imply resource utilization.

A system can have many small bottlenecks. Therefore it is useful to distinguish between local inefficiencies and a global one. This is the main constraint of a system.



There are two types of efficiency:

- Efficiency of resources. 
    - Measured by resource utilization, which is defined as: "The percentage of time the resource is producing something which is contributing to the main goal". This definition excludes the production of e.g. spare parts.
    - Risks: inventory (over-production), over-stretching of resources, over-optimization (silos).
    
- Efficiency of flow (to customer). I.e. [pull-strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Push%E2%80%93pull_strategy), demand-oriented. Because the customer pays for the service.

Assume that people are never [blocked](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context_switch) and [always](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson's_law) busy. Focus on the flow of *tasks*; ensure that they are not blocked. If tasks are picked up as planned (following demand), then people can be free to make improvements and learn.

> Low idle time is a side-effect of flow efficiency but not a method of reaching it.

In a *balanced* system, all resources produce exactly the right amount. There is no excess inventory. This theoretical state is dangerous. Any perturbation (expected variance) would be detrimental to flow, because all components are related and depend on each other. This inherent risk can be contained in two fundamental ways:

- Increase inventory. This decreases agility and limits cash flow.
- Decrease batch sizes, which decreases lead time. This increases setup time (handovers).



**Effectiveness**

The two main directions to be effective are:

- Deliver (maximize) value to customer. This may require investment and innovation (change).
- Eliminate (minimize) waste. This doesn't just demand reliability and stability, but it also requires an investment to remove obstacles.

This involve

- Continuous improvement of purposes, people, processes.
- Continuous discovery of value and waste.

Note that investment involves a short term cost by definition.



**Types of Challenges**

Fundamental characteristics of the world (from [Buddhism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_marks_of_existence)):

1. Change. Nothing is permanent (time moves forward). As a result, systems degrade and expire. Hence there is a need to adapt, transform and sometimes start over. Naturally, even methods itself have to be adapted.
2. [Interdependence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_theory). Consider components and connections. Hence we should embrace collaboration over isolation.
3. Dissatisfaction. Repetition is boring. Hence there is a need to iterate, learn and improve.

In addition, learning (adapting) takes practice. Both at the individual and organizational level.





Local improvements and adaptation are a vital complement to top-down strategies.

- This requires alignment on all levels. Hence higher management should share their vision and strategy within the organization.
- Local improvements are usually easier than global ones.



**Work environment**

Company values should be reinforced though the work environment. E.g. if software quality is valued then internal software should also be of high standards.



## Collaboration

Reaching consensus on what *needs* to be done is easier than reaching consensus on what *can* be done.

Determine whether a team needs to **adjust** or whether it needs to **change**. Two different approaches can be:

- Use ceremonies & tools for team alignment (i.e. slight adjustment), until the desired behaviour or culture has been reached.
- Apply the concept of a "fresh start" whenever you want to change or disrupt the current way of working. E.g. formulate former practices or habits as something the "old" team would do, and the new practice as something you would do from now on.

Make sure there is regular reflection, both on the level of individuals and the level of teams.



Make goals and problems **visible**. E.g. using a scrum or kanban board, milestones. Dashboards, alerts, red/green builds. This incentivizes us to think about them (and re-think our approach).



**Meetings**

- Publish a schedule or agenda beforehand and stick to it. I.e. set expectations.
- Schedule time to do preparation and post-preparation.
    - These should be roughly proportional the length of the meeting and the number of participants.
- Avoid overfull meetings. Allow flexibility for attendees.



**Persistence**

One-pagers. One page is enough to introduce an idea but does forces the writer to be concise. In addition they are well-suited for collaboration. Although they are abstract, the corresponding idea should be measurable in order to be effective.



**Turnover**

- Warm welcome. Put in special care for team members that join and leave. These are critical moments.
- Note down their first impressions. This is a unique moment where one can get unbiassed input.



## Organizational Learning

An optimal learning environment has:

- A teacher/coach/facilitator
- Other learners
- Customer or real-world feedback

Learning requires both theory and practice (experimentation). Making mistakes is a vital part of learning.

- Prefer collaboration over competition. The latter discourages mistakes, and thus hampers learning.

Learning on a local level is easy, but learning at the "middle management level" is not (e.g. due to competition, fear of failure).





## Management per Type

**Crisis management**

- Dealing with risk after they've materialized.



**Expectation management**

- Under-promise (and over-deliver) to stakeholders. Avoid uncertainty and build trust.
- Over-promise internally, in order to motivate employees. In addition, prefer learning over blaming.

Technique:

1. What do you expect?
2. This is what you can expect. This is what we will do.



**Time management**

Let the other accept your schedule. Not everything is possible, so force the client to choose explicitly. Communicate transparently.

There is never enough time, but there are three ways to manage it: prioritization, efficiency and multiplication.

Prioritize *core* activities and defer, drop or delegate (outsource) *contextual* activities.

Sometimes efficiency can be improved by changing processes or technology.

Time can be multiplied. 

- Teach others *why* and *what* instead of *how*. Empower others to do it independently.
- Broadcasting instead of point-to-point communication. E.g. write a blog post or wiki instead of a long email.



### Risk management

Definitions:

- Risk: a future undesirable event and events that precede it.

- Risk management: dealing with unpleasantness, instead of counting on luck.

The main *prerequisite* is a certain corporate culture: Thinking in probabilities & decriminalize risk. Uncertainty should be preferred over being wrong (or overly optimistic).

- Prefer mean-variance optimization over point-estimates. A typical prediction should include (un)certainty bounds. E.g. "We need at least 4 months, and it may take up to 1 year (in the worst case). We estimate a 80 % chance of finishing it in 6 to 8 months. "
- Express projects success not as an absolute (success or fail), but as progression (number of features delivered at end of time period).
    - Build in slack, i.e. the flexibility to skip/add/change features during the project.

A secondary prerequisite is a list of assumptions. These are (usually show-stopping) risks that are delegated upwards to the employer. This reduces the change of overlooking "unthinkable" risk.



**Types of Strategies**

1. General strategies:
    1. Avoid or limit tail-risk rather than focussing on winning.
    2. Diversify to handle idiosyncratic (unsystematic) risk. I.e. make multiple small bets over a single large one.
2. Specific strategies that don't address risk:
    1. Avoidance: don't take risks at all (but miss out on potential wins).
    2. Evasion (retainment): count on luck, assume low-probability events won't occur.
3. Specific strategies that do address risk:
    1. Containment: decrease impact of risk when they do occur. E.g. reserve *buffers*.*
    2. Mitigation: reduce containment cost. This has an up-front cost, independent of whether the risk will materialize. 



*Given a set of independent risks, the risk exposure per risk is the product of the probability of occurrence and the cost of occurrence. A conservative *buffer* is strictly higher then the total exposure. 

> Risk exposure = probability of risk times the cost of occurrence



**Types of Containment Strategies**

- Isolate; use layering.
- Minimize
- Monitor; collect information about the incident and the second-order effects. E.g. uncommon patterns.
- Active Defense



**Types of risks**

- Planning-related:
    - Inherent flaws in the schedule. E.g. an unrealistic, aggressive schedule
    - Requirements inflation; an increase in requirements over the scope of the project.
    - Ambiguity in the specification. Design decision that are deferred until implementation time.
    - Dependencies.
- Employee-related:
    - Employee turnover.
    - Poor productivity. E.g. due to lack of motivation, poor working conditions, problems with communication, collaboration or coordination.
- User-related
    - Usability (user interaction).
- Context-related
    - Adaptability (to new environments). E.g. scaling up.
    - Supply chain / dependencies.



## Miscellaneous

Gaining knowledge

- Start with a prior belief, collect data, update your belief, and repeat.



Types of work

- Planned work or pre-defined work.
  - Business projects. E.g. directly related to customer demand.
  - Internal projects. Enable business projects.
  - Changes. E.g. maintenance.
- Unplanned work. Work as it appears.
  - Firefighting. E.g. incidents, recovery work.

- Defining work. Planning
    - Adjusting, changing plans.


Work needs to be defined (to some extend) before it can be delegated.



**Knowledge**

Four types of knowledge

- Known knowns: mastery
- Known unknowns: self-awareness
- Unknown knowns: hidden potential
- Unknown unknowns: blind spots



**Stability / Reliability**

Single point estimates (e.g. the mean) are a poor predictor of stability. The following image shows that chaotic (random) and cyclical processes - which are fundamentally different - can have the same mean.
