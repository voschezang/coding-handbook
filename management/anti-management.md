# Secret Management Principles

There are countless management theories, but most managers follow their own principles. In practice, many decisions are biassed by emotions and politics. This document lists a few secret principles, that most managers will not belief. In practice, these principles will usually be violated. See also [anti-Agile](../software-engineering/anti-agile.md).



Delivery

- Deliverables create accountability. Handovers break accountability. 

- Larger batches = larger handovers. Larger batches increase complexity.
- Inventory is waste, not value. Progress on deliverables > internal progress.
- Releasing frequently reduces incidents.

Validation

- Skipping validation is efficient, until it isn’t.  Implicit assumptions = rework. Releasing more pilots decreases cost
- Failing early is cheap. An MVP does not have to be usable.
- Experiments require hypotheses. Postponing a decision ≠ running and experiment.
- Most decisions are made on the basis of intuition, not facts.
- Accountability requires accounting. No feedback = no accountability.
- Can it be built? → Should it be built?

Optics & confidence

- Overwhelmed managers chase silver bullets.
- The more afraid the manager, the less room for uncertainty.
- Numbers lie. You can make data say anything.
- Metrics are people, too.
- Big words hide small thinking. Big words are impressive. 

Optimization

- Local optima differ from global optima.
- Optimizing utilization reduces performance.
- Sabotage kills companies.



And some negations.

- Busyness ≠ progress
- Larger team ≠ impact
- Titles ≠ impact
- Authority ≠ truth
