# Bets

Bets are tools to *test beliefs*. They are light-weight versions of [scientific experiments](../intelligence/scientific-method.md) that validate and verify hypotheses. They are especially useful in complex environments where higher order effects are common. Also see [results](results.md).

Bets can have several forms. They should be sized according to the amount of uncertainty. Otherwise they result in wasted time or reckless risk taking.
