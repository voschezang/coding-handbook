# Force

[toc]

## Net Forces

The net force is the linear sum of forces.

```
F = ∑ f
```



## Attractive Force (Gravity)

A symmetric force between two masses, in inverse directions. This force contributes to acceleration. The total acceleration of an object is the result of the net force divided by its mass.

```
F = m · a
a = ∑ F / m
```

## Repulsive Force (Diffusion)

Particles in fluid and gas states behave like a concentration that diffuses or disperses over the available volume (space). As a whole, the concentration has mass, but a local level it has density. The concentration will disperse until it reaches an equilibrium.

## Normal Force

[Normal force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_force)

- Direction is perpundicular to a surface.
- Magnitude is equal to the inverse of the incoming force in the opposite direction.

## Drag and Resistance

Resistance can be caused by inertia or [drag](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_(physics)). Forces may attract or repel.

## Change

The position of an object can be defines as a function of time. In absense of acceleration, the position `x` at timestamp `Δt` is equal to the sum of its initial position and the product of its velocity and the duration `Δt`. Formally:

```
x(Δt) = x(0) + v(0) · Δt
```

The general form of this is a [Taylor series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series).
