> Math is never just numbers

```tex
(8+1)^2 = 81
```

```math
e^π \approx π^e
```

Percentages are reversible: 20% of 60 equals 60% of 20.



**Superposition**

A probability distribution of possible values.

Collapse: a single 100% probability value.



**Schrödingers cat**

Copenhagen interpretation

- The superposition = `[cat is alive, cat is dead]`
- Act of observing causes the superposition to collapse to a single event: the cat being dead or alive.

Many-worlds interpretation

- The superposition = `[you observe the cat being alive, you observe the cat being dead]`
- The observer is part of the wave function.
- The observer is entangled with he experiment.
