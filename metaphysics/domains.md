## Overview

The universe can be split up into five domains. The first split of reality is made based on *lifeforms*. The second split is based on the dynamics that emerge in populations of lifeforms. Third, there are the common beliefs that are held by lifeforms. Fourth, there exist eternal ideas that may or may not be known to any being. The categories range from objective and material to subjective conventions and virtuality.

Higher structures tend to conflict with lower structures. They consist of emergent patterns that oppose or reject the rules of the latter. E.g. social structures limit biological desires, ideological structures disrupt social structures.

1. **Inorganic** structures. Pure existence. This involves the world of physics. It consists of matter and energy.
2. **Biological** structures. Subjectivity. These are specific lifeforms and the dynamics between them. 
3. **Social** structures. Others. These are patterns that consist of multiple lifeforms.
4. **Intellectual** structures. Shared concepts and memories. Ideals. Conventions.
5. **Eternal** structures. These are concepts that are not contingent upon lifeforms or matter. These structures tend to be difficult to define.

Note: this ordering assumes that lifeforms are organic, i.e. based on carbon-based molecules.



## Quality

Quality can reach local optima at each level.

- Inorganic structures: physical qualities. E.g. strength-mass ratio.
- Biological structures: feelings. the edges of homeostasis. Balance: homeostasis.
- Social structures: care for basic human needs. Utility.
- Intellectual structures: better frameworks to embody knowledge?

These domains show similarity to the [7 chakras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chakra#The_seven_chakra_system), in the order from Muladhara to Sahasrara.

| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------- | -------------------- |
| **Inorganic** structures     | Existence, being                                             | Physical qualities      | Strength-mass ratio  |
| **Biological** structures    | Subjectivity. Lifeforms, [life-cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_life_cycle). | Sensations, experience. | Joy                  |
| **Social** structures        | Others. Communities of subjects                              | Utility                 | Provide for citizens |
| **Intellectual** structures. | Virtual. Spiritual. Ideas hold by subjects                   | Capability              | Conventions          |
| **Eternal** structures       | Ideals                                                       | Oneness                 |                      |



> Math is never just numbers

A few examples of eternal structures.

- Nothing. The empty set `∅`. The number `0`.
- Unity. The identity function `I`. The number `1`.
- Infinity: `∞` .
- `i` The imaginary number.
- `π` The ratio of a circle's circumference to it's diameter.
- `e`  Euler's number
- `∫` [Functions](../domain-modelling/functions-relations.md)



## Organizations

Structures such as organisms and organizations exist in all domains at the same time. They are contingent on their lower-level structures.



### Examples

|                       | Blood cell                           | Human                                       | City                       |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Inorganic view**    | Molecules                            | Molecules                                   | Buildings, citizens, roads |
| **Biological view**   | Nucleus, cytoplasm                   | Cells, DNA                                  | A population that can grow |
| **Social view**       | Cardiovascular system, immune system | A *person* with rights and responsibilities | Communities, businesses    |
| **Intellectual view** | Roles                                | A subjective worldview, opinions, memory    | Conventions                |
| **Eternal view**      |                                      | Human nature                                | Urban nature               |

Note that the components in each perspective are subject to *different* forces. Molecules are subject to gravity, but a population is not. A person is a subject of the law, but molecules are not.



## Health

These domains can be mapped to Aristotle's [four causes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_causes).

- Inside view
    - Material health. Inner structure. The network of components that make up the structure.
    - Natal/life-cycle health. The origin (birth) of the structure. How the structure evolves. E.g. growth of a human body or corporation.
- Outside view
    - Positional view. The position of the structure in its environment.
    - Functional view. The role of the structure in it's environment. It's purpose.

Notes

- The environment of an object or structure can be an organization, system or society.
- The material structure can be further decomposed into atomic parts and the relations between them. E.g. molecules that form organs in a human body.



### Examples

In a capitalist society.

|                             | Person                        | Corporate Department                       |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Material** (inorganic)    | Network of biological system. | Network of teams                           |
| **Life-cycle** (biological) | Childbirth                    | Founding of the corporation and department |
| **Position** (social)       | Family member                 | Position in the corporate hierarchy        |
| **Function** (intellectual) | Job                           | Output of the department                   |



### Health

|                       | Person                            | Corporate Department     |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Material health**   | Physiological health              | Health of employees      |
| **Life-cycle health** | Nutrition, growth                 | Support from management  |
| **Positional health** | Health of relationships           | Health of bureaucracy    |
| **Functional health** | Ability to participate in society | Ability to deliver value |
