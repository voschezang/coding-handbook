## Material and Immaterial World

Reality can be deconstructed into a material and immaterial world.

- The material world consists of matter and energy.
- The immaterial world consists of universal concepts and social conventions.



**Material World**

Structures that can be measured. They may change, decay or perish. This includes:
- Objects and their properties. [Mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass%E2%80%93energy_equivalence) and energy.
- Relations between objects. E.g. the [four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_interaction) physical forces.
- Emergent structures.
    - [Waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave). E.g. [sound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound) waves or [fluid dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_dynamics).
    - Phenomena. E.g. the [flocking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flock_(birds)) of birds, [migrations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration) of animals.




**Immaterial World**

Structures that have either a universal or eternal aspect.

- Universal **concepts** are true in our universe, independent of the presence of subjects (observers).
- **Conventions** and knowledge emerges in our universe. They are brought into existence by historic events: by being defined by a subject. Their syntactic meaning is persistent, but their semantic meaning is contingent upon subjects. They emerge and can be communicated, but they do not exist in a specific place. See [knolwedge](../intelligence/knowledge.md).
  - Examples of conventions: the metric system, natural language.



Universal concepts include

- Universal constants. E.g. the speed of light, Ï€, *e*, *h*.

- Conceptual structures. These are eternal and do not depend on the presence of a subject.
    - Algebra's. Formal systems. Set theory. Category theory.
    - Numbers. Geometry. Calculus. Statistics.
    - [Imaginary numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imaginary_unit).



## Classical Views

Plato's dualism

- Forms. Concepts or ideals. Similar to [type classes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_class). Eternal structures that cannot not exist. E.g. the concept *horseness*.
    - Higher forms: forms of concepts.
    - Lower forms: forms of phenomena.
- Particulars. Instances of a form. E.g. physical objects. They exist contingently in the natural world, both epistemically and ontologically. E.g. a *specific horse*.



Material objects can be understood from different [perspectives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_causes) or causes.

- Formal perspective. The class of an object. E.g. the type of dog (breed).
- Material perspective. What the object is made of. E.g. living cells, DNA.
- Origin. How the structure has come into existence. E.g. birth.
- Purpose. Why the object exists.
