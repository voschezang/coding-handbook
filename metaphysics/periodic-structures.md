# Periodic Patterns

Waves have a period `T` and a frequency (rate)  `f = 1/T`. See [waves](../math/waves.md).



**Pattern (wavelength)**

Astrology

- Seasons (years)

- Moon cycle (months)
- Day-night cycle (days)

Ecology

- Predator-prey cycles (years)
- Animal reproduction cycle (seconds - years)

Humanity

- Civilizations, empires, cities (centuries)
- Corporate organizations (decades)
    - Departments and teams in organizations. Their size (and scope) influences how fast they change. Resizing teams translates to adjusting frequencies to obtain a better wavelength.
- Human lifecycle (decades)
- Sleep cycle (day)
- Breathing (minutes)
- Hearth rate (seconds)
- Neural oscillation (ms)

Engineering

- [AC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternating_current) (Hz)
- [Clock rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_rate) (GHz)

Physics

- Sound (ms)
- [Electromagnetic radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_radiation), e.g. light (λ)
- Particle radiation (α, β)
