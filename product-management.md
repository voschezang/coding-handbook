# Product Management

Work and features can be divided into an abstract, long-term strategy and specific, short-term tasks.

## Tasks

### Types of Tasks

The generic concepts PoC and MVP can be applied to tasks and features:

- **Proof of concept** ([PoC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_concept))
    Build an experimental application and learn on the way. The goal is not to develop finished end-product but rather to demonstrate feasibility and/or learn what a production-like application would entail (and gain a head-start).

- **Minimum Viable Product** ([MVP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product)): 
    Deploy a minimal feature ASAP s.t. you can collect early feedback and improve it iteratively. Maximize the amount of learning (e.g. from users/customers) with the least amount of effort. It emphasizes the value of customer-feedback is 
- **Minimum Lovable Product** (MLP): 
    Work towards a release that will overwhelm customers/end-users. In case of infrastructure this could mean an automated and sufficiently secured and monitored system.



### Content of tasks

Subtasks can be explained in a single sentence, but (large) tasks can be defined more thoroughly.

The questions that should be answered are as follows (ordered by importance). This is based on [Kanban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban) and [PDCA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDCA).

- What problem does this task tackle?
- What are the current and target conditions?
- What is the minimal scope of the task?
- What are the steps / sub-tasks that are involved?
- What are the next steps?

Before closing a task an appropriate review should be done to validate whether its purpose has been fulfilled.



### Planning

**Prioritization of future work**
Two different methods to plan work:

- Sprints of 1-4 weeks. The team commits to a certain set of tasks. This commitment is used as a motivational goal rather than an obligation: left-over tasks should be seen as an indication rather than improvement rather than a failure. In non-specialist teams the diversity of the work in the sprint should be taken into account.
- No sprints, but instead use a continuously updated backlog. Whenever a task is finished the tasks that is at the top of the backlog can be picked up. This requires a limit on the amount of work in progress. The team has more freedom and should have a high level of discipline.

**Prioritization of work in progress**
Maximize flow and minimize inventory (i.e. blocked tasks). This can be achieved by prioritizing tasks that have already been started over new tasks. Address blocked task immediately instead of avoiding them.
