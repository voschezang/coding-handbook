# Project Management

This document is about refining and implementing an assignment. Such an assignment can be for example a project or user-story. See also [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_project_management), [product-management](product-management.md)  [management principles](management-principles.md) and [requirements-engineering](requirements-engineering.md).

## Overview

There are a few phases that can be distinguished in a typical assignment.

- **Refining** the assignment to ensure that for example the right feature will be build.
    - It is likely that *your interpretation* of the initial requirements is imperfect.
    - There can be *ambiguity* - or even imperfection - in the initial requirements. It may be beneficial to analyze the problem in advance.
    - During the implementation of the project the context may *change* - which could require deviations for the planning. Hence there is some risk management involved.
- **Execution** of the refined assignment. This phase may reveal surprises. This may lead to deviations.
    - This may include resourcing.
- **Review** of the implementation. This includes communication to stakeholders.



### Refinement

Alignment with:

- Stakeholders. E.g. the assigner or sponsor.
- [Customers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer). E.g. the ones that will recipient some service or product.
- Employees and hires.



#### Planning

An assignment can be broken down into sub-tasks. For both these levels there is a certain amount of [requirements engineering](requirements-engineering.md) involved.



#### Sizing

Projects can usually be split up into smaller parts that are delivered immediately - to customers. Estimating the optimal granularity *a priori* is difficult. The major benefits of small deliverables are:

- Provide revenue *sooner*.
- Allow subsequent iterations to incorporate *feedback* from customers.
- Reduce the amount of *unused* features.

This is an alternative to delivering the whole project in one go - and never looking back. This iterative way of working is considered to be [*agile*](scrum-guide.md).

It is especially beneficial in context with the following problems:

- There is uncertainty in the demand from customers. This creates a risk of building the wrong product.
- There is uncertainty w.r.t the progress of the project. Any problems that arise might be discovered too late.
- There are risk associated with the duration of project. E.g. when missing a deadline would be catastrophic.

**Evaluating risk and uncertainty**

- Is the demand from customers clear?
- Is the proposal technically feasible? If not, then consider starting with experiments.
- Will progress be measurable?
