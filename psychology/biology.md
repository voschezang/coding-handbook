# Brain

Two major organs of the human body are the brain and the vagus nerve.

## Triune Brain

This [model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triune_brain) distinguishes three functional layers that complement each other. They follow the evolutionairy progression from reptiles to mammals.

|                 | Reptillian Brain                                      | Limbic Brain                                                 | Neocortex                                                    |

| **Examples**    | Breathing, sleeping                                   | Fight and flight responses                                   | [Executive functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_functions) |
| **Formal name** | [Brain stem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainstem) | [Paleomamalian cortex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limbic_system) | Neomamalian brain                                            |

Development

- The reptilian section brain is developed before childbirth.
- The mamalian sections of the brain are developed in early childhood. E.g. a baby that explores the world.

## Nervous System

Two distinct parts of the nervous system are the [sympathetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sympathetic_nervous_system) and [parasympathetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasympathetic_nervous_system) systems. 

- In the context of arousal and mobilization, they exhibit a tension-release like interaction. the former system accelerates and [mobilizes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fight-or-flight_response), while the latter bring the body back to rest. 
- In certain conditions, a *freeze* response may occur, where the body immobilizes. This can be a repsonse to danger or hyper-arousal.

[Polyvagal theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyvagal_theory) recognizes two modes of parasympathetic nervous system, basd on its *dorsal* (rear) and *ventral* (front) side. The former is associated with dissociation (freezing), while the latter is associated with social engagement.

### Hierarchy

Hierarchy of the [nervous system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nervous_system)

- [Central nervous system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_nervous_system) (CNS). Brain stem and spinal chord.


  - [Peripheral nervous system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peripheral_nervous_system) (PNS)
    - [Somatic nervous system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic_nervous_system). Control of body using skeletal muscles.
    - [Autonomic nervous system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomic_nervous_system) (ANS) or visceral nervous system. E.g. heart rate, digestion, sexual arousal.
      - [Sympathetic nervous system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sympathetic_nervous_system) (SNS).  Accelerate: fight or flight responses.
      - [Parasympathetic nervous system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasympathetic_nervous_system) (PSNS).  Brake. Slow down, preserve.
      - [Enteric nervous system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enteric_nervous_system) (ENS). Digestive system.

- [Endocrine system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endocrine_system). Release hormones.
