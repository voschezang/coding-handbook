# Desire

Two flavours of a simple model for desire and human needs.

1. The primary layer is physical and psychological safety. E.g. food, water, shelter.
2. The middle layer relates to the position (belonging) in a society. Either a status or ability to participate. A typical metric is net worth.
3. The top layer relates to forms of enlightenment. Actualizing ones true potential. Being at peace.
