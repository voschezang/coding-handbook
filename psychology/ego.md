# Ego

The concept ego has a simple [definition](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ego), but has a variety of implications, specificaly across cultures. One the one hand it can be interpreted as a strong sense of self (confidence) and one the other hand it can be a buildup of baggage and expectations.

Also see [identity](../subjects/identity.md).



## Alternative definitons

- The self. The false self. A mirror-like reflection of your self.
- How others percieve you. How you think others perceive you.
- A [layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Id,_ego_and_superego) between the id and the superego (Freud).
- One of the [alter ego's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alter_ego).



## Evolution

Expression may rely on *association* and *differentiation*.

- In traditional cultures the ego expressed through association with groups, roles and institutions. E.g. being a mother, a father, a christian, a muslim. 
  - Significance is given by the authority of the associations. E.g. membership of a guild.
- In capitalist cultures the ego ego is elevated to become its own *brand*. It is decoupled from its enviroment and origin. 
  - Significance is given by self-promotion. It aims to differentiate itself from other brands.

Both relate to different values.

- Traditional values rely on membership and respect, in the context of a local community (or family). This implies participation and contribution. Being available.
- The second type values liberty: individual and intellectual freedom. Innovative ideas are favored over conventions and tradition.
  - This is encouraged by globalism: interaction across (far-away) cultures.

After finding a new shared identity, a new sub-culture may - theoretically - move back to traditional values.
