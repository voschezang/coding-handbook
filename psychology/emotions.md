# Emotions

## Overview

>  Experience is a verb.

Emotions are a form of experience. They are dynamic in the sense that they are experienced. Emotions are intertwined with  feelings. Both experience and feeling are verbs that relate to activity.

Layers of emotion

1. A **feeling**. Contraction or expansion. Energy, stress or relaxation.
2. An **emotion**. E.g. forms of joy, sadness, fear, anger, disgust.
3. A **judgement**. Whether you can manage the situation and feeling.



> Emotions can be experienced in endlessly new ways.

Emotions revolve around quality (liking).

1. **Experience** can be pleasant, unpleasant, numb or confusing.
2. The **primary emotions** are happiness (joy), sadness, anger and fear. They indicate *quality*, or the loss of it.
3. Physiological emotions relate to **physiological needs** such as hunger or thirst. E.g. fatigue or lust.
4. Other emotions relate to social or **intellectual needs**. E.g. curiousity or sympathy.



Awareness of emotions.

1. What you feel. Nuances in feelings.
2. Why you feel it. Origin of feelings.
3. What you need.



### Role and subjectivity

Emotions are used as communication devices. Between your body and mind and between yourself and others. 

- They attract healthy objects.
- They repulse harmful objects.



Emotions are highly dependent on the environment and someone's interpretation of it. For example, image the difference between seeing a lion in the zoo or on the street. See [appraisal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appraisal_theory) and [priming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priming_(psychology)).

- Interpretation depends on recognition and familiarity.



## Physiological States

The simplest distinction of feeling is to classify it as **positive** or **negative**. Note that negative feelings are not inherenlty good or bad.

A more nuanced distincition is:

- **Contraction**. Tension. Shield off.
- **Expansion**. Release. Relaxation. Welcome.



Feelings that indicate physiological states.

- Contraction or expansion (relaxation).
- Pleasure and pain.
- Energy and fatigue.
- Warmth and coldness. Temperature.
- Relaxation and tension. Seriousness and goofiness.
- Comfort and anxiousness. Safety.



Trust is associated with pleasantness, recognition and familiarity. Distrust is associated with uncertainty and risk.



## Pleasantness & Activation

Two dimensions can be distinguished in feelings and moods: **pleasantness** (quality) and **activation** (energy).

Some higher dimensions are guilt, shame and surprise. These reflect (dis)liking of a primary emotion in a certain context.



## Primary Emotions

Emotions communicate *qualities* and personal needs. This communication is directed both towards the self and others.

- Happines indicates quality of pleasure. Sadness indicates the loss of it.
- Anger indicates conflict and disruption of quality. It relates to crossing [boundaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_boundaries) and [pushing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression).
- Fear indicates risks to quality. E.g. threads or danger.

  - Awe. Indicate otherworldiness.
  - Disgust. Indicate poison.
- Desire
  - Preference.
  - Love.
  - Obsession, fanaticism.

  - Curiosity (wonder).

  - Confusion.

  - Surprise or disbelief (skepticism).

  - Empathy and sympathy.



## Flow

> Surf the waves of emotions.

Emotions *disrupt* the human body temporarily. After a burst of emotions (e.g. crying or laughing), the human body tends to return to a [balanced state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis). 



### Problems

Persistent emotions are a problem. Rather than reacting to an incident, the body becomes stuck a response state. This can result in either

- An absense of emotions. E.g. [apathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apathy).
- A persistency of specific emotions. E.g. depression, hate and paranoia.

These signal an imbalance.  



## Coping

**Tools (by acronyms)**

3. Agency. Exercise influence.

### Avoiding emotions

> Suppressing takes energy. embracing frees up energy.

Emotions can be unpleasant. People use different strategies to  avoid them.

- Prevention. Avoid situations that may trigger emotional responses.
- Distraction. Shift attention elsewhere.
- Suppression. Numb emotions.

Avoidance may result in either a less vibrant (numb) life, or in eruptions of emotions at a later point in time. Note that in case of eruptions of emotions, the emotions themselves are merely signals of an underlying problem.

Experiencing negative emotions is unpleasant, but it can avoid future problems.
