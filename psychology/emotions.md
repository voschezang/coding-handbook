# Emotions

> Emotions can be experienced in endlessly new ways.

Emotions are dynamic. They are experienced, rather than fixed. They revolve around quality (liking).

1. Experience ranges from pleasant to unpleasant. They can be useful.
2. The primary emotions are happiness (joy), sadness, anger and fear. They indicate *quality*, or the loss of it.
3. Physiological emotions relate to physical needs such as hunger or thirst. E.g. fatigue or lust.
4. Other types of emotions relate to social or intellectual needs. E.g. curiousity or sympathy.

Emotions are used as communication devices. Between your body and mind and between yourself and others. In addition, they are highly dependent on the environment and someone's interpretation of it. For example, image the difference between seeing a lion in the zoo or on the street.



Awareness of emotions.

1. What you feel. Nuances in feelings.
2. Why you feel it. Origin of feelings.



## Pleasantness & Activation

From a high level, two dimensions can be distinguished: **pleasantness** (quality) and **activation** (energy).

Some higher dimensions are guilt, shame and surprise. These reflect (dis)liking of a primary emotion in a certain context.



## Primary Emotions

Emotions communicate *qualities* and personal needs. This communication is directed both towards the self and others.

- Happens indicates quality of pleasure. Sadness indicates the loss of it.
- Anger and fear indicate conflict, disruption and loss of quality. Anger relates to crossing [boundaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_boundaries) and [pushing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression).

## Flow

> Surf the waves of emotions.

Emotions *disrupt* the human body temporarily. After a burst of emotions (e.g. crying or laughing), the human body tends to return to a [balanced state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis). The two extreme deviations of this are an absense of emotions and a persistency of specific emotions. These signal an imbalance. Examples of long-term, persistent emotions are depression, hate and paranoia.



**Avoiding emotions**

> Suppressing takes energy but embracing frees up energy

There are three typical methods to avoid emotions.

- Prevention. Avoid situations that may trigger emotional responses.
- Distraction. Shift attention elsewhere.
- Suppression. Numb emotions.

Avoidance may result in either a less vibrant (numb) life, or in eruptions of emotions at a later point in time. Note that in case of eruptions of emotions, the emotions themselves are merely signals of an underlying problem.

Experiencing negative emotions is unpleasant, but it can avoid future problems.
