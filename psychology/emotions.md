## Overview

>  Experience is a verb.

Emotions are a form of experience. They are dynamic in the sense that they are experienced. Emotions are intertwined with  feelings. Both experience and feeling are verbs that relate to activity.

> Emotions can be experienced in endlessly new ways.

Emotions revolve around quality (liking).

1. **Experience** ranges from pleasant to unpleasant. They can be useful.
2. The **primary emotions** are happiness (joy), sadness, anger and fear. They indicate *quality*, or the loss of it.
3. Physiological emotions relate to **physiological needs** such as hunger or thirst. E.g. fatigue or lust.
4. Other emotions relate to social or **intellectual needs**. E.g. curiousity or sympathy.



Awareness of emotions.

1. What you feel. Nuances in feelings.
2. Why you feel it. Origin of feelings.



### Role and subjectivity

Emotions are used as communication devices. Between your body and mind and between yourself and others. 

- They attract healthy objects.
- They repulse harmful objects.



Emotions are highly dependent on the environment and someone's interpretation of it. For example, image the difference between seeing a lion in the zoo or on the street. See [appraisal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appraisal_theory) and [priming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priming_(psychology)).

- Interpretation depends on recognition and familiarity.



## Pleasantness & Activation

Two dimensions can be distinguished in feelings and moods: **pleasantness** (quality) and **activation** (energy).

Some higher dimensions are guilt, shame and surprise. These reflect (dis)liking of a primary emotion in a certain context.

## Experience

There exist various models to explain experience of stimuli and sensations.

- "Common sense". Physiological reaction is caused by emotion, which is caused by an intense event.
- [James-Lange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James%E2%80%93Lange_theory). Emotion is a result of a by a physiological reaction to an intense event.
- [Cannon-Bard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannon%E2%80%93Bard_theory). Emotion and arousal are affected by subcortical brain activity (reptillian brain).
- [Schachter-Singer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-factor_theory_of_emotion). Emotion is a result of appraisal of a physicological reactions to an intense event.



Phases

## Flow

> Surf the waves of emotions.

Emotions *disrupt* the human body temporarily. After a burst of emotions (e.g. crying or laughing), the human body tends to return to a [balanced state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis). 



### Problems

Persistent emotions are a problem. Rather than reacting to an incident, the body becomes stuck a response state. This can result in either

- An absense of emotions. E.g. [apathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apathy).
- A persistency of specific emotions. E.g. depression, hate and paranoia.

These signal an imbalance.  



### Avoiding emotions

> Suppressing takes energy but embracing frees up energy

Emotions can be unpleasant. People use different strategies to  avoid them.

- Prevention. Avoid situations that may trigger emotional responses.
- Distraction. Shift attention elsewhere.
- Suppression. Numb emotions.

Avoidance may result in either a less vibrant (numb) life, or in eruptions of emotions at a later point in time. Note that in case of eruptions of emotions, the emotions themselves are merely signals of an underlying problem.

Experiencing negative emotions is unpleasant, but it can avoid future problems.
