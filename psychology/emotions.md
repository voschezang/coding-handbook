# Emotions

## Overview

> Emotions can be experienced in endlessly new ways.

Emotions are dynamic. They are experienced, rather than stationary. They revolve around quality (liking).

1. **Experience** ranges from pleasant to unpleasant. They can be useful.
2. The **primary emotions** are happiness (joy), sadness, anger and fear. They indicate *quality*, or the loss of it.
3. Physiological emotions relate to **physiological needs** such as hunger or thirst. E.g. fatigue or lust.
4. Other emotions relate to social or **intellectual needs**. E.g. curiousity or sympathy.



Awareness of emotions.

1. What you feel. Nuances in feelings.
2. Why you feel it. Origin of feelings.



### Role and subjectivity

Emotions are used as communication devices. Between your body and mind and between yourself and others. 

- They attract healthy objects.
- They repulse harmful objects.



Emotions are highly dependent on the environment and someone's interpretation of it. For example, image the difference between seeing a lion in the zoo or on the street. See [appraisal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appraisal_theory) and [priming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priming_(psychology)).

- Interpretation depends on recognition and familiarity.



## Pleasantness & Activation

Two dimensions can be distinguished in feelings and moods: **pleasantness** (quality) and **activation** (energy).

Some higher dimensions are guilt, shame and surprise. These reflect (dis)liking of a primary emotion in a certain context.



## Primary Emotions

Emotions communicate *qualities* and personal needs. This communication is directed both towards the self and others.

- Happens indicates quality of pleasure. Sadness indicates the loss of it.
- Anger indicates conflict and disruption of quality. It relates to crossing [boundaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_boundaries) and [pushing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aggression).
- Fear indicates risks to quality. E.g. threads or danger.

### Physiological states

Feelings that indicate physiological states.

- Pleasure and pain.
- Energy and fatigue.
- Warmth and coldness. Temperature.
- Relaxation and tension. Seriousness and goofiness.
- Comfort and anxiousness. Safety.



Trust is associated with pleasantness, recognition and familiarity. Distrust is associated with uncertainty and risk.



## Flow

> Surf the waves of emotions.

Emotions *disrupt* the human body temporarily. After a burst of emotions (e.g. crying or laughing), the human body tends to return to a [balanced state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeostasis). 

### Problems

Persistent emotions are a problem. Rather than reacting to an incident, the body becomes stuck a response state. This can result in either

- An absense of emotions. E.g. [apathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apathy).
- A persistency of specific emotions. E.g. depression, hate and paranoia.

These signal an imbalance.  



### Avoiding emotions

> Suppressing takes energy but embracing frees up energy

Emotions can be unpleasant. People use different strategies to  avoid them.

- Prevention. Avoid situations that may trigger emotional responses.
- Distraction. Shift attention elsewhere.
- Suppression. Numb emotions.

Avoidance may result in either a less vibrant (numb) life, or in eruptions of emotions at a later point in time. Note that in case of eruptions of emotions, the emotions themselves are merely signals of an underlying problem.

Experiencing negative emotions is unpleasant, but it can avoid future problems.
