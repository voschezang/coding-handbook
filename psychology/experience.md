# Experience

Experience is an activity. It consists of feeling and thinking.

> How you feel â‰  what you feel.

Sensation is done with three representational systems.

- Auditory - hearing
- Kinesthetic - feeling, touching
- Visual - seeing

Other feelings (hunger, temperature) are left out in this model.







Experience can be inward, outward, individual and social. See [integral theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_theory_(Ken_Wilber)).

|                | Inward                     | Outward                       |
| -------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Individual** | Consciousness (subjective) | Behaviour (objective)         |
| **Social**     | Culture. Shared ideas      | Processes, systems, structure |



**Body and mind**

The states of the human body and mind can differ. A few examples.

|                                  | Good state of mind (satisfaction)              | Bad state of mind (dissatisfaction)       |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Good state of body (comfort)** | Joy and peace, trust                           | Loss of faith, dissatisfaction, pessimism |
| **Bad state of body (unwell)**   | Winning at sports, despite physical exhaustion | Suffering from pysical injuries           |

Note that there is a difference bewteen what you like and what is good for you.
