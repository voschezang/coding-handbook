# Experience

Experience is an activity. It consists of feeling and thinking.

> How you feel â‰  what you feel.

Sensation is done with three representational systems.

- Auditory - hearing
- Kinesthetic - feeling, touching
- Visual - seeing

Other feelings (hunger, temperature) are left out in this model.





Experience can be inward, outward, individual and social. See [integral theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integral_theory_(Ken_Wilber)).

|                | Inward                     | Outward                       |
| -------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Individual** | Consciousness (subjective) | Behaviour (objective)         |
| **Social**     | Culture. Shared ideas      | Processes, systems, structure |



**Body and mind**

The states of the human body and mind can differ. A few examples.

|                                  | Good state of mind (satisfaction)              | Bad state of mind (dissatisfaction)       |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Good state of body (comfort)** | Joy and peace, trust                           | Loss of faith, dissatisfaction, pessimism |
| **Bad state of body (unwell)**   | Winning at sports, despite physical exhaustion | Suffering from pysical injuries           |

Note that there is a difference bewteen what you like and what is good for you.

## Attention and Dissociation

Dissociation can happen in many forms. A few common examles are daydreaming or taking a walk *on autopilot*, without paying attention to where you're going. 

Note that people are highly influenced by their environment. They react to subjective observations and will change their behaviour (and perception) based on cultural expectations.



Dissociation in **thoughts**.

- Thoughts that arise in your mind can be formulated in the first or second person. E.g. "I feel", "You could".



Dissociation in **experience**. This can happen gradually or disruptively:

- Being *present*. Paying attention. Being immersed in an environment.
- Being *distracted*. Either being focussed on something else, or being not focussed at all.
- Being *not yourself*. Deviating from your standard behviour. E.g. being highly emotional. This can happen as response to stressful situations.
- Showing radical changes in personality. Changes in behavioural patterns. Potential loss of memory after episodes.
- Hallucinatory experiences. Not being able to distinguish between fantasy and reality.

Note that the last type is controversial. In the western scientific community, any spiritual experiences tend to be disregarded.



## Frustration and Depression

Depression is not just a result of working too hard. Some contributing factors:

- Discrepancy between desires and reality. E.g. wanting other people to change.
- Lack of agency or compentency.
- Lack of alignment with the organization.

Contrarywise, consider the following factors.

- Following a vision with passion for the direction.
- Excelling and achieving results.
- Taking breaks after sprinting to celebrate succes and rest.
- Engagement with a community.
