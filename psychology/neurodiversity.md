# Neurodiversity

People can be divided into two groups.

- Neurotypical. The majority (~80%) of people. 
- Neurodiverse. Minorities and outliers.



Neurodiversity is a type of *cognitive specialization*. People in this goup have greater variation in skills and *qualities*. They are also less predictable and may challenge social norms. 

In general, modern environments are optimized for typical people. This can create a bias for conformity.



**Problem**

> It's a contextual problem, rather than a medical problem.

Perspectives

- As a *medical* problem. In extreme forms, neurodiverse traits have so many adverse effects that they're treated as a cognitive disorders or disabilities.
- As a *contextual* problem. Neurodiverse traits may be beneficial and adversarial in different environments or cultures.



A few examples of unusual/extreme/rare behaviour:

- Impulsivity. The tendency to act immediately, without carefull planning.
- The need (compulsion) to fidget or move around.
- Mood swings.
- Extreme (in)attention.

Note that these are not inherently disfunctional. Rather, they would be disfunctional in specific environments.
