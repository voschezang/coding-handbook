## Overview

> The Self does not exist.

A personality is the collection of behavioural, cognitive and emotional patterns of a person. The Self is a multiplicity. It adapts to different environments. It consists of a range of static patterns or roles that can be triggered by associations. When learning, one develops new patterns.

- Patterns can be useful in a specific context and adverse in another.
- Suppressing (old) patterns costs energy.

### Extremes

*Temperament* is a concept that describes the level of reactivity and energy. How strong people respond to stimuli.



People may identify themselves with specific patterns, e.g. their thoughts. 

- [Dissociative identity disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociative_identity_disorder) (DID) is characterized by an extremely high decoupling of personalities.
- [Borderline personality disorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borderline_personality_disorder) (BDP) is characterized by episodes of extreme feelings and instability.

### Qualities & Allergies

Core quality quadrant: personal qualities & risks

> Each allergy signifies an underlying quality

For each *quality* or trait, there is an extreme which usually has adverse effects. This presents a *risk*. Often, the behaviour associated with addressing this risk is the reverse of the quality. Behaving in the opposite direction of the initial quality is *challenging*.

The extreme side of the challenge may conflict with the initial quality. This is the *allergy*.
