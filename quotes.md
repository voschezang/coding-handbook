## Time to market
- What one person can do in nine months, nine persons can do in one month.
- Before software can be reusable it first has to be usable.

## DevOps

* Let's give developers admin rights on production machines.
* DevOps is just [vertical intergration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_integration).
  * Specialization can be achieved by scoping down the product (and/or outsourcing).
* Take calculated risks, make mistakes and learn from them.
  * This requires an automated build/test process.


## Automation & Testing

* If you have expert developers you don't need to waste time on unit tests.
* Our build process is not automized because it is so complex that it requires experts to do it manually.
* Our testing process is not automized because it is so complex that it requires experts to do it manually.
* 100% test coverage means that all possible input values are considered. This would include all `integers`.

## Programming languages
- Runtime errors are a (language design) choice.
- --Hit compile-- Break time.
- Just get the code to compile, so we can get to real work: debugging.
- Java is so flexible that it has neither of the advantages of a strong type system and a dynamic one (with duck typing).
- C++ has default arguments AND function overloading.
- Design patterns should be expressable on the language level. E.g. partial functions, Python's `@decorator`, Elm's `Maybe.andThen`.
