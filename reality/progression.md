# Progression

Reality tends to change over time. This is either a *progression* or a *regression*. See [domains](domains.md), [forces](forces.md) and [structures](structures.md).



Progression may result in *optimization* or *expansion*.

- Optimization happens in sequence (on top) of the current structure. The result is contingent upon the old structure.
- Expansion happens in parallel (in addition) to the current structure. The result may replace the old structure.



Progression requires a cycle of *innovation* and *preservation*. 

- Too much preservation leads to stagnation.
- Too much disruption leads to degeneration (degradation).



Innovation is a disruption that ends with preservation. The disruption needs to be latched onto something static.

1. Innovation starts with a disruption, an action (a thesis).
2. This action creates a reaction (anti-thesis). It disrupts the status quo. The reaction is proportional to the action.
3. The change in reality needs to be resolved into a new structure that can be preserved (synthesis). The disruption needs to be latched onto a static reality.



Structures may emerge as a result of these dynamics.

- Static patterns provide a safety net. They facilitate experimentation.
