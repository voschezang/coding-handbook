## Examples

An ordering of structures (aggregates) from microscopic to macroscopic scale. New properties emerge at higher levels. Higher level structures transcend lower level structures, but can still be contingent on them. Note that this structure is not a [total ordering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_order).



**Inorganic structures**

1. Subatomic particles.
2. [Elementary particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_particle) and [radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_radiation).
3. Composite particles. E.g. protons, neutrons.
4. Atoms. E.g. carbon, coper.
5. Atomic structures. [Chemical bonds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_bond), [chemical compounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound). E.g. molecules, ionic compounds.
6. Solid [matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_of_matter), liquid, gas and plasma.
7. Planets
8. Solar systems



**Biological structures**

1. Macromolecules. E.g. DNA, protein
2. [Cells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology))
3. Organisms

Types of organisms

1. Viruses
2. Bacteria
3. Plants. Rhizomes.
4. Animals. E.g. mammals. Humans



**Social structures**

1. [Symbiosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbiosis). E.g. [pollination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pollination).
2. Family
3. [Kinship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinship)
4. Businesses
5. Society
6. Culture
7. Nation
8. Ecosystems



**Intellectual structures**

1. [Conventions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_(norm)). Embodied knowledge. E.g.
    1. Sign language
    2. Rituals
    3. Natural language
    4. Drawing
    5. Writing
2. [Symbolic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbol) structures. Maps. Models and conventions that can be mapped to reality. E.g. an [algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebra).
3. [Memes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme).



**Eternal structures**

- Concepts



**Emergent properties & dynamics**

- Phase transitions of molecules
- Cell replication
- Mutation of DNA
- Birth, [embryonic development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_embryonic_development)
- Sexual selection - based on (survival) value.
- Human [trade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trade) - based on (monetary) value.

## Preservation

Higher level structures are preserved and protected by boundaries. Such boundaries prevent the structures from degrading. They maintain order. They facilitate repetition.

- [Cell walls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_wall) to preserve cells.
- Biological [immune system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immune_system) to protect the organism.
- Marriage to preserve relationships.
- Religion to preserve unity in a community.
- Tradition to preserve stability in a community.
- Oral tradition to preserve culture in a community.
- [Inquisition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inquisition) to protect purity.
- The police to preserve order, class systems, private property or to prevent crime.
- Writing to preserve ideas.
- City walls to preserve society.
- Kingdoms (authority/power) to preserve communities.
- Governments to preserve communities.
- Bureaucracy to preserve organizations.
- Nations to preserve countries.



**Roads & Walls**

Both roads and walls facilitate flow of value.



City walls have a dual purpose.

- They protect citizens from external threads.
- They facilitate the flow of goods, services and ideas.



Roads are less absolute than walls. They facilitate movement in a pre-determined direction.

- They protect social structures, by connecting them.
- They influence movement by means of attraction and repulsion.



**Laws**

Emergent patterns that control structures. E.g. an institution is designed to preserve an idea. The power that is exhibited by that institution results in laws that control the system.

- Physical laws that control matter.
- [Law of the jungle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_jungle) that control survival.
- Economic laws that control markets.
- Governmental laws that control citizens.
- Ethics that control behaviour.



## Innovation

> Innovations disrupt order

Innovations are disruptions with a certain potential. Innovation produces higher-level structures that transcend lower-level structures.

- The cost and benefit of a disruption may change over time. In general, an innovation is a thread to the preservation of the status quo.



### Types of innovations

**Communication**-oriented.

- Oral tradition to transmit history.
- Religion to give rise to shared purpose
- Writing
- Printing press
- Radio to transmit mass media.
- Scientific journals

**Value**-oriented.

- Agriculture and [animal husbandry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_husbandry). Grow value.
- [Currency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency). Facilitate exchange of value.
- [Marketplace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marketplace). A platform that facilitates the flow of value.
- [Free market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_market)
- [Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Company). A legal entity.
- [Academia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy)



### Overcoming Laws

Higher level structures tend to show emerging behaviour. They overcome (transcend) lower-level laws. This may be in contrast to the laws of the lower-level organizational patterns.

- Fish that swim against the current.
- Birds that fly.
- [Selective breeding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_breeding).
- [Engineers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering) that develop industry.
- Scientists that develop [biological engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_engineering).
