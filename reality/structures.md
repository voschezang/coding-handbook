# Perspectives of Reality

[toc]

## Introduction

Reality tends to change over time. This is either a *progression* or a *regression*. 

**Progression**

Progression may result in *optimization* or *expansion*.

- Optimization happens in sequence (on top) of the current structure. The result is contingent upon the old structure.
- Expansion happens in parallel (in addition) to the current structure. The result may replace the old structure.



Progression requires a cycle of *innovation* and *preservation*. 

- Too much preservation leads to stagnation.
- Too much disruption leads to degeneration (degradation).



Innovation is a disruption that ends with preservation. The disruption needs to be latched onto something static.

1. Innovation starts with a disruption, an action (a thesis).
2. This action creates a reaction (anti-thesis). It disrupts the status quo. The reaction is proportional to the action.
3. The change in reality needs to be resolved into a new structure that can be preserved (synthesis). The disruption needs to be latched onto a static reality.



Structures may emerge as a result of these dynamics.

- Static patterns provide a safety net. They facilitate experimentation.



## Domains

The universe can be split up into five domains. The first split of reality is made based on *lifeforms*. The second split is based on the dynamics that emerge in populations of lifeforms. Third, there are the common beliefs that are held by lifeforms. Fourth, there exist eternal ideas that may or may not be known to any being.

1. **Inorganic** structures. This involves the world of physics. It consists of matter and energy.
2. **Biological** structures. These are specific lifeforms and the dynamics between them. 
3. **Social** structures. These are patterns that consist of multiple lifeforms.
4. **Intellectual** structures. Shared concepts and memories. Ideals. Conventions.
5. **Eternal** structures. These are concepts that are not contingent upon lifeforms or matter. These structures tend to be difficult to define.

Note: this ordering assumes that lifeforms are organic, i.e. based on carbon-based molecules.



**Quality**

Quality can reach local optima at each level.

- Inorganic structures: physical qualities. E.g. strength-mass ratio.
- Biological structures: feelings. the edges of homeostasis. Balance: homeostasis.
- Social structures: care for basic human needs. Utility.
- Intellectual structures: better frameworks to embody knowledge?

| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------- | -------------------- |
| **Inorganic** structures     | Matter, energy                                               | Physical qualities      | Strength-mass ratio  |
| **Biological** structures    | Lifeforms, [life-cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_life_cycle). | Sensations, experience. | Joy                  |
| **Social** structures        | Communities of subjects                                      | Utility                 | Provide for citizens |
| **Intellectual** structures. | Ideas hold by subjects                                       | Capability              | Conventions          |
| **Eternal** structures       | Ideals                                                       | Oneness                 |                      |



A few examples of eternal structures.

- `âˆ…` The empty set.
- `I` The identity function.
- `0` The number zero.



### Organizations

Structures such as organisms and organizations exist in all domains at the same time. They are contingent on their lower-level structures.



#### Examples

|                       | Blood cell                           | Human                                       | City                       |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Inorganic view**    | Molecules                            | Molecules                                   | Buildings, citizens, roads |
| **Biological view**   | Nucleus, cytoplasm                   | Cells, DNA                                  | A population that can grow |
| **Social view**       | Cardiovascular system, immune system | A *person* with rights and responsibilities | Communities, businesses    |
| **Intellectual view** | Roles                                | A subjective worldview, opinions, memory    | Conventions                |
| **Eternal view**      |                                      | Human nature                                | Urban nature               |

Note that the components in each perspective are subject to *different* forces. Molecules are subject to gravity, but a population is not. A person is a subject of the law, but molecules are not.



## Health

These domains can be mapped to Aristotle's [four causes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_causes).

- Inside view
    - Material health. Inner structure. The network of components that make up the structure.
    - Natal/life-cycle health. The origin (birth) of the structure. How the structure evolves. E.g. growth of a human body or corporation.
- Outside view
    - Positional view. The position of the structure in its environment.
    - Functional view. The role of the structure in it's environment. It's purpose.

Notes

- The environment of an object or structure can be an organization, system or society.
- The material structure can be further decomposed into atomic parts and the relations between them. E.g. molecules that form organs in a human body.



#### Examples

In a capitalist society.

|                          | **Material**                  | **Life-cycle**                             | **Position**                        | **Function**             |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| *Domain*                 | *Inorganic*                   | *Biological*                               | *Social*                            | *Intellectual*           |
| **Person**               | Network of biological system. | Childbirth                                 | Family member                       | Job                      |
| **Corporate Department** | Network of teams              | Founding of the corporation and department | Position in the corporate hierarchy | Output of the department |



#### Health

|                          | **Material health**  | **Life-cycle health**   | **Positional health**   | **Functional health**             |
| ------------------------ | -------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Person**               | Physiological health | Nutrition, growth       | Health of relationships | Ability to participate in society |
| **Corporate Department** | Health of employees  | Support from management | Health of bureaucracy   | Ability to deliver value          |



## Structures

An ordering of structures (aggregates) from microscopic to macroscopic scale. New properties emerge at higher levels. Higher level structures transcend lower level structures, but can still be contingent on them. Note that this structure is not a [total ordering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_order).

4. Atoms. E.g.carbon, coper.
5. Atomic structures. [Chemical bonds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_bond), [chemical compounds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_compound). E.g. molecules, ionic compounds.
