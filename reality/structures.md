# Perspectives of Reality

[toc]

## Introduction

Reality tends to change over time. This is either a *progression* or a *regression*. 

**Progression**

Progression may result in *optimization* or *expansion*.

- Optimization happens in sequence (on top) of the current structure. The result is contingent upon the old structure.
- Expansion happens in parallel (in addition) to the current structure. The result may replace the old structure.



Progression requires a cycle of *innovation* and *preservation*. 

- Too much preservation leads to stagnation.
- Too much disruption leads to degeneration (degradation).



Innovation is a disruption that ends with preservation. The disruption needs to be latched onto something static.

1. Innovation starts with a disruption, an action (a thesis).
2. This action creates a reaction (anti-thesis). It disrupts the status quo. The reaction is proportional to the action.
3. The change in reality needs to be resolved into a new structure that can be preserved (synthesis). The disruption needs to be latched onto a static reality.



Structures may emerge as a result of these dynamics.



## Domains

The universe can be split up into five domains. The first split of reality is made based on *lifeforms*. The second split is based on the dynamics that emerge in populations of lifeforms. Third, there are the common beliefs that are held by lifeforms. Fourth, there exist eternal ideas that may or may not be known to any being.

1. **Inorganic** structures. This involves the world of physics. It consists of matter and energy.
2. **Biological** structures. These are specific lifeforms and the dynamics between them.
3. **Social** structures. These are patterns that consist of multiple lifeforms.
4. **Intellectual** structures. Shared concepts and memories. Ideals.
5. **Eternal** structures. These are concepts that are not contingent upon lifeforms or matter. These structures tend to be difficult to define.

Note .This ordering assumes that lifeforms are organic, i.e. based on carbon-based molecules.



### Examples

|                       | Human                                     | City                           |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Inorganic view**    | Molecules                                 | Buildings, citizens, roads     |
| **Biological view**   | Cells, DNA                                | A population that can grow     |
| **Social view**       | A *person* with rights and responsibility | Communities, business          |
| **Intellectual view** | A subjective worldview, opinions, memory  | Culture, a position in history |
| **Eternal view**      | Human nature                              | Urban nature                   |

Note that the components in each perspective are subject to different forces. Molecules are subject to gravity, but a population is not. A person is a subject of the law, but molecules are not.



Other examples of eternal structures.

- `âˆ…` The empty set.
- `I` The identity function.
- `0` The number zero.
