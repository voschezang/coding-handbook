## Principles

- Use multiple time-boxed exercises to stimulate a good balance of going wide and going deep.
- Follow-up on interesting answers.



## Introductions

### Read the room

#### Weather report

How do you feel, after the last week? Choose one of either:

```markdown
- Storm
- Rain
- Clouds
- Sunshine
```

How did you make this choice? What events did you consider?



#### ESVP

How do you feel? Use one of the following categories. [src](https://retromat.org/en/?id=1)

- Explorer. Eager to learn.
- Shopper. Optimistic and ready to find a good deal.
- Vacationer. Relax and observe.
- Prisoner. Feel forced to participate.
```

What did you take into account for this choice?



### Expectation Management

```markdown
- What is the purpose of this session?
- What do you need from this session?

```

- Motivation. How can we motivate ourselves to do this? 
- Ease. How can we make it easy to do? 
- Reminder. How will we remember to do this? 
```



## Brainstorming / Sense making

### Sailboat

```markdown
- What our wind? What pushes us forward?
- What's our sun? What gives us energy?
- What's our goal? In what direction are we moving?
- What our anchor? What keeps us in place?
- What are the reefs? What risks are out there?
```



### Train Station

Image that you're on a train station. Your train is delayed. [src](https://retromat.org/en/?id=127)

```markdown
- Destination. Where is your train going?
- Delay. How much delay is there? What contributed to this?
- Announcement. What is the announced reason for the delay?
```



### Worst case scenario

Compile a list of ideas:

```markdown
- What would turn the next week/month into a disaster?
- If we
