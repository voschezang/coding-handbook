# Scrum

This document is compatible with the [Scrum guide](https://www.scrum.org/) (2021). The official guide is a concise set of rules rather than guidelines. Although this format can make it seem dogmatic,  the intent is genuine. This document attempts to explain certain decisions and covers some implications of them.



**Intro**
Scrum is designed for small teams that manages a single product in a [complex environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cynefin_framework). It is a framework that helps teams to be [agile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development); to be able to inspect and adapt. Consequently, it advocates for iteration, as opposed to [functional phases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model). 

In theory it is a light-weight framework, but it does require a major [cultural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organizational_culture) shift: a product mindset. 

**Values**
Next to a product-mindset, Scrum advocates the following values: `commitment, focus, openness, respect, courage`. How these values are applied in practice is left as an exercise to the team.

**Static Requirements**
A typical answer to uncertainty is to tighten requirements. However, this just constrains the solution; it doesn't address the underlying problem.



**Success**

In Scrum, success consists of the following facets

- Value delivered to customers.
- Ownership of the team.



## Roles

A Product Owner (PO) is a single person that manages a long-living, continuously updated product. The PO is accountable for the following items, but does not necessary have to do them alone:

- Developing and communicating the product goal and strategy. 
    - Prioritizing *new* features and deciding which *existing* features to keep.
    - Choosing the target market.

- Mediation between stakeholders, customers and the development teams.



The Scrum master (SM) includes:

- Removing impediments.
- Educating the organization on Scrum.

It is [servant leader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servant_leadership), rather than a boss, chairman, scribe, secretary or police agent.



The rest of the development teams does not have a hierarchy and are instead self-organizing. They should hold each other accountable (as a team) rather than by an external party.

They deliver periodic increments of work, which can be released 



The Scrum teams consists of the SM and Development team. It excludes stakeholders. The Development team includes developers and the PO.



Anti-patterns: micromanagement, PO without authority, too many dependencies.

## Events

Sprints are effectively short projects with a fixed length of at most one month. The only exception to this is a cancelled sprint. New sprints start automatically after the previous sprint has ended. 

Each sprint contains five formal events, which are opportunities to inspect and adapt. Ideally they don't take up the full capacity each month.

| Event                | Inspection                         | Adaption                              | Who Attends              | Time-box for 1 Month |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------- |
| Daily Scrum          | Progress towards Sprint Goal       | Sprint Backlog                        | Development Team         | 15 min. (fixed)      |
| Sprint Planning      | Product Backlog                    | Sprint Goal, Sprint Backlog, Forecast | Scrum Team, Stakeholders | 8 hours              |
| Sprint Review        | Increment, Sprint, Product Backlog | Product Backlog                       | Scrum Team, Stakeholders | 4 hours              |
| Sprint Retrospective | Sprint                             | Improvements                          | Scrum Team               | 3 hours              |



**Daily Scrum** 

This event that occurs daily, at the same place and time.



**Sprint Planning**

- Why is this sprint valuable?
- What can be done this sprint.
    - The definition of done is defined by the team.
- How will this be done? E.g. split backlog items up into manageable or predictable tasks or stories.



## Artifacts



| Artifact                              | Commitment         |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Product Backlog (list of future work) | Product Goal       |
| Sprint Backlog (selection of backlog) | Sprint Goal        |
| Increment (finished work)             | Definition of Done |
