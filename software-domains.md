## Software Domains

Any specific system usually has a balance between domain-oriented components and generic (facilitating) components.

An application usually relies on libraries and [SaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service), [PaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service) or [IaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_a_service) components.

**Types**

- Hardware type: CPU, GPU, FPGA
- Hardware context: embedded, desktop, mobile, web, web-app
- Application Development (individual components)
- Application Architecture: e.g. a distributed monolith
- System Architecture: e.g. microservices
- Infrastructure (within a datacenter or using multiple datacenters)

Software can be managed at different **levels**.

- **Platform**/internal technology: this should usually be stable.
- **Product**: deliver value to customers.
- **Process**: complement the above by continuously improving.
- **People**: from personal well-being (of colleagues and teams), to maximizing potential.
