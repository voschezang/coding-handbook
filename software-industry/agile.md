## Agile

Agile software development is a set of practices that optimize for complex environments. Agility helps to deliver value sooner, safer and happier.

## Overview

Agile values, based on the [Agile manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/). The right-hand side is associated with project management in the 90s.

|      | Agile                        | Non-Agile                   |
| ---- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| 1.   | Individuals and interactions | Processes and tools         |
| 2.   | Working software             | Comprehensive documentation |
| 3.   | Customer collaboration       | Contract negotiation        |
| 4.   | Responding to change         | Following a plan            |

These affect products, people and processes.

In practice, this requires:

- Self-organizing and cross-functional teams.
- Awareness of the value chain and the freedom to improve it.
- Short feedback loops. E.g. continuous integration.



|                       | Agile                   | Non-Agile                    |
| --------------------- | ----------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Focus**             | Value & user experience | Cost & profit                |
| **Structure**         | Self-organizing teams   | Isolated teams (silos)       |
| **User requirements** | To be discovered        | Fixed, determined in advance |



### Example

Given an environment with complex problems and ambiguous, uncertain or unstable requirements, there are several approaches one can take: 

- Start with better planning. Documenting as much as you can.
- Start building the most likely solution and commit to finishing it.
- Start by solving a small part of the problem. Afterwards reconsider what to next.
- Start with prototypes to validate assumptions (validated learning). Work iteratively towards more realistic designs.

The last two are agile approaches.



### Benefits

*Why should capitalists care?*

Agile attempts to:

- Increase long term revenue by delivering more value.
- Deliver value sooner, which means that the revenue stream starts sooner.
- Be resilient to uncertainty and risks through agility.



*Why should developers care?*

Agile is associated with:

- A happier and more relaxed work environment.
- More agency and involvement in decision making.
- Less meetings and deadlines



### Empiricism

Obtain knowedge through experience, rather than *a priori* theory. This relies on:

- Transparancy. Shared understanding.
- Inspection. Reflecting on what we have done, continuously.
- Adaption. Update plans when you obtain new information.



|              | Transparency             | Inspection                 | Adaption                         |
| ------------ | ------------------------ | -------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Question** | What do we do? For whom? | How is it going?           | What can we improve?             |
| **Method**   | ‚û°Ô∏è‚û°Ô∏è‚û°Ô∏è Value chain          | üîÅ Feedback loops           | üîÄ Be able to adapt               |
| **Enabled**  | Shared understanding     | Reflection & conversations | Owernship, self-organizing teams |

This graph shows the granularity of increment verses the development stages. The steepness of the line is associated with risk apetite.
