This document explores the resistance to Agile ideas. First the implicit difficulties of Agile and second the counter cultures.

## Introduction

Agile makes amazing promises about performance, yet non-agile approaches are still widespread. People even attack Agile approaches. What’s happening in the real world? Here's an overview of common the risks and misinterpretations of Agile.

- **Uncertainty**. Agile means admitting uncertainty. Accepting that there are (unknown) unknowns. People often prefer certainty and stability. Doubt is scary in itself. 
  - Managers are under pressure to promote stability and security. Stakeholders demand confidence and reassurance. There is a desire to be in control.
  - Admitting complexity
- **Overhead**. The uncertainty in Agile results in additional meetings. Agile seems to promote short roadmaps, rather than thorough long term planning. It seems to promote last minute decisions.
- **Complexity**. Agile can be complex and counter-intuitive. It is full of paradoxes (link). Defending Agile approaches requires discussing processes and indirect effects.
  - In practice, obsolete plans are treated as incidental, a shortcoming of individuals rather than an inherent problem with the approach.
- **Fragile**. Agile methods require vulnerability and courage. Agile relies on transparency and admitting unknowns. Socially, it requires psychological safety and trust. 
  - This doesn’t match with many commercial, high-stakes environments. Organizations are full of power dynamics, conflicting roles etc. Adopting agile in the wrong corporate culture will backfire.
- When teams perform well, it seems unnecessary to talk about risks.
- Large batches feel efficient intuitive. See [release frequency](../labour/release-frequency.md).



## Anti-Waterfall

Agile can become a counter culture. Opposed to traditions, with minimal structure. The following tables shows typical patterns for leadership culture, (performance) evaluation and project delivery.

### Leadership culture

|                            | Traditional                       | Anti-Waterfall                                   | Pragmatic / Emperical                                |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Leader**                 | Being in control / on schedule    | Listen to customers, adapt plans frequently      | Create environment + alignment                       |
| **Organization Structure** | Strict (matrix)  hierarchy        | Flat, self-managing teams                        | Product and platform teams                           |
| **Philosophy**             | Pressure drives performance       | Happy developers yield happy customers           | Incentives drive behaviour                           |
| **Accountability**         | Leader > subordinates             | Collective ownership > individual accountability | Attribute success to team, failure to leaders        |
| **Success**                | Finished projects are celebrated  | Finished sprints are celebrated                  | Performance is tracked by leading + lagging metrics. |
| **Failure**                | Blame culture, find rotten apples | Blameless culture                                | Strict on process, lenient on mistakes.              |

### Evaluation

|                           | Traditional                                           | Anti-Waterfall                                         | Pragmatic / Emperical                   |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| **Performance Reviews**   | Output theater. Handoffs = blame game.                | Agile theater. JIRA = value.                           | Evaluation based on pre-defined metrics |
| **Status updates**        | Polished updates mask reality                         | Stand-up theater. Retrospectives focus on inclusivity. | Address team health and performance.    |
| **Risk Management**       | Risks are downplayed, until they become an emergency. | Risks are discussed  thoroughly                        | Risks are input for validation          |
| **Organizational Memory** | Archive culture                                       | Conversations >  documentation                         | Writing culture                         |

### Delivery

|                | Traditional                      | Anti-Waterfall                                 | Pragmatic / Emperical                                        |
| -------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Methodoloy** | Big releases based on vision     | Experiment-driven. Build-measure-learn cycles. | Balance persistent strategies with experimental learning     |
| **Philosophy** | More people → more output        | Maximize stories per sprint                    | Less WIP → more speed                                        |
| **Planning**   | Top-down project planning        | Demand drives short-term planning.             | Top-down guidelines, strategic goals.                        |
| **Adapting**   | Resist change, downplay feedback | Over-pivot                                     | Validated learning to adjust course. Deliberate adaptation guided by outcomes. |
