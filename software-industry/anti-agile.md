# Anti Agile

Agile makes amazing promises about performance, yet non-agile approaches are still widespread. People even attack Agile approaches. What’s happening in the real world? Here's an overview of common the risks and misinterpretations of Agile.

- **Uncertainty**. Agile means admitting uncertainty. Accepting that there are (unknown) unknowns. People often prefer certainty and stability. Doubt is scary in itself. 
  - Managers are under pressure to promote stability and security. Stakeholders demand confidence and reassurance. There is a desire to be in control.
  - Admitting complexity
- **Overhead**. The uncertainty in Agile results in additional meetings. Agile seems to promote short roadmaps, rather than thorough long term planning. It seems to promote last minute decisions.
- **Complexity**. Agile can be complex and counter-intuitive. It is full of paradoxes (link). Defending Agile approaches requires discussing processes and indirect effects.
  - In practice, obsolete plans are treated as incidental, a shortcoming of individuals rather than an inherent problem with the approach.
- **Fragile**. Agile methods require vulnerability and courage. Agile relies on transparency and admitting unknowns. Socially, it requires psychological safety and trust. 
  - This doesn’t match with many commercial, high-stakes environments. Organizations are full of power dynamics, conflicting roles etc. Adopting agile in the wrong corporate culture will backfire.
- When teams perform well, it seems unnecessary to talk about risks.
- Large batches feel efficient intuitive. See [release frequency](../labour/release-frequency.md).
