# Engineering

## Overview

Engineering focusses on producing high quality results.

This requires:

- Collaboration and strategy. Managing long term objectives and short term activity. See [performance](../collaboration/teams.md).
- Validated learning. See [discovery](../labour/discovery.md) and [learning](../intelligence/learning.md).
- Delivery. Finishing assignments/exercises/projects. See [realization](../labour/realization.md).
- Management of capabilities. See [systems engineering](systems-engineering.md).

It aims to do so reliably and predictably.

Engineering is surrounded by product management. It's boundaries are busines administration, sales, etc.

## Collaboration

Significant work is done in collaboration. Organizations are usually divided in departments and teams. This structure is directly [related](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_law) to production. 

It entails

- Communication
- Leadership



### Performance

It involves

- Team success
- Team performance.



|                     | Success                      | Performance    |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------- |
| **Functional view** | Team vision                  | Value delivery |
| **Social view**     | Team dynamics                | Production     |
| **Biological view** | Trust (appreciation, safety) | Team health    |

## Optimization

> Everything can be sped up.

The wrong way to optimize is to automate something, then speed it up, then simplify it and finally get rid of it completely. The opposite order is:

1. Understand the process. Walk through all the steps (together).
2. Delete (parts of) it.
3. Simplify it.
4. Speed it up.
5. Automate it.



> Deletion is painful.

Two styles:

- Aggressive. Overcorrect. Delete more that you should. Expect to put some steps back after deleting it.
- Conservative. Be overly careful. This leads to leads to accumulation of waste over time. 



**Anti-patterns**

- Optimize something that is not used.
