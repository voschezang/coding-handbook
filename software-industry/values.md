## Agile

> Happy teams, happy customers

> Embrace change, rather than attempting to control.

Context

- Complex domain



Note: Agile is not a goal in itself.

Values. See [Agile manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/). The right-hand side is associated with project management in the 90s.

|      | Agile                        | Non-Agile                   |
| ---- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| 1.   | Individuals and interactions | Processes and tools         |
| 2.   | Working software             | Comprehensive documentation |
| 3.   | Customer collaboration       | Contract negotiation        |
| 4.   | Responding to change         | Following a plan            |

These affect products, people and processes.

In practice, this requires:

- Self-organizing and cross-functional teams.
- Awareness of the value chain and the freedom to improve it.
- Short feedback loops. E.g. replace control layers with automated testing.



### Empiricism

Obtain knowedge through experience, rather than *a priori* theory. This relies on:

- Transparancy. Shared understanding.
- Inspection. Reflecting on what we have done, continuously.
- Adaption. Update plans when you obtain new information.



### Scrum

> Inspect-Adapt-Reflect.

See [Scrum guide](collaboration/scrum-guide.md). 

1. Deliver value each increment
2. Use an empirical approach: be transparent, inspect and adapt.



## Kanban

> Visualize-Stabilize-Optimize. 

First you have to find the right challenge (e.g. the bottleneck). Second you have to find stability, otherwise you cannot reliably control it. Only then you can start to optimize.

- The long-term version of this is [PDCA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDCA).



## DevOps

See [DevOps](DevOps.md).

Goal

-  Deliver value sooner, safer and happier.

Values

- 3 Steps: Focus on the value chain. Incorporate customer feedback. Do continuous improvement.
- You build it, you run it.
- Be able to release 100 times per day.

Method

- Design for failure
- If it's risky, do it more often



## Lean

Principles

1. Focus on customer value
2. Identify value stream, from concept to cash
3. Flow, minimize lead time, flow efficiency
4. Pull, don’t over produce
5. Strive for perfection, high quality.  This is mostly for *complicated* rather than *complex* domains

**`0` Zero quality layers**

Instead, build-in quality and improvement into every stage or component. In organizations, let everyone improve, rather than hiring a consultant to do it for them.

**`1` Focus**

> Focus means saying no

- Limit [WIP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_in_process). Focus on flow. Be inefficient. Multitasking is wasteful. Be long term patient and short term impatient.
- Limit change-in-progress. Cognitive overhead is demanding of employees - it drains energy
- Strive for 1 goal per timescale.

**`∞` Continuous improvement**

- Assume ignorance. Be ready to learn.

- Design for failure. Setup experiments that can fail. Do risk management.
- Think big and work small.

**`6σ` Lean**

Applicable to *complicated* rather than *complex* domains

1. Focus on customer value
2. Identify value stream, from concept to cash
3. Flow, minimize lead time, flow efficiency
4. Pull, don’t over produce
5. Strive for perfection, high quality.  This is mostly for *complicated* rather than *complex* domains

**`★` North Star**

Communicate your vision. Tell your story.

**`Δ` Think big, work small. Long term patient, short term impatient**

- Think big, work small. Align on a high level and release in small increments.

- Be long term patient but short term impatient. Long term: be able to see things through. Short term: focus on continuous but direct improvements.
- Separate goals and dreams. Be impatient in reaching goals, but patient when working towards a dream.
- Micro pessimist, macro optimist
- Separate goals and dreams. Be impatient in reaching goals, but patient when working towards a dream.

**`±` Accept uncertainty. Find out what you don't know.**

Do experiments and learn.

**`~` Flow**

Moving with the flow is easier than moving against the flow. Vibrating at the same wavelength creates stronger waves.
