# Activity

[toc]

## Subject-oriented view

A more fine-grained categorization is obtained by distinguishing *vita activa* and *vita contemplativa* (based on [Hannah Arendt](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hannah_Arendt#Arbeiten_und_Herstellen)).

**Vita activa** Be active. Focus on engagement with the world. The [purpose](purpose.md) may differ:

- Arbeiten (labour): Care for survival (self-preservation).
- Herstellen (production): Care for the external world.
- Handeln (acting): Care for the greater good.



> Not all those who wander are lost.

**Vita contemplativa**. Contemplate. Focus on internal experience of the world.

- Entspannen (relaxing). Lingering. Resting.
    - [Uparati](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uparati). Cessation, stopping.




## Vita Activa

> Active people roll like a stone, confirming to the stupidity of mechanics.

Nietzsche called vita activa a form of laziness. True activity would be to reject conformity.



Types of activity

|                            | Arbeiten                | Herstellen                | Handeln                 |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| **English interpretation** | Labour                  | Production, manufacturing | Action                  |
| **Output**                 | Consumption             | Utilities, art            | Change                  |
| **Outcome**                | Self-preservation       | World of things           | Society                 |
| **Nature of the product**  | Inferior to the subject | Additions to the subject  | Superior to the subject |

*Utilities* are products that have *some* purpose, rather than merely being consumption.



Note the difference in the nature of the activities: continuation, results and change.

- Labour focusses on a *continuation* of the subjects themselves.
    - It is never-ending.

- Production focusses on external *results*: utilities or art.
    - It results in an otherness: an [external](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marx%27s_theory_of_alienation), objective world. "A world of things."
    - It has a bias for results and alienation. It relates to [instrumentalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumentalism): where objects are evaluated based on purpose and usefulness.

- Action focusses on *change* of society.



**History**

In history, there has been a shift from *"Work so that you may rest"* to *"Rest so that you may work"*.

In premodern eras, life consisted of an abundance of vita contemplativa. After modernization, the world became more efficient and labour-oriented. People started to focus on productivity.



### Purpose

> Walking without hesitation becomes a march

A subject's purpose can be categorized as follows.

- Purpose-driven.
  - Self-preservation. Continuation of the subject. A perpetual quest for survival.

  - Expansion. Extending a lifestyle. Diversifying an organization.
  - Change. Affecting change in either the subject's identity or the social structure that subject is part of. E.g. political change.

- Free of purpose. Before a purpose.
  - Leisure or appreciation. Being present. Lingering. Paying attention to the moment. A purpose that is not external. Free from any interest or compulsion.

**Horizon**

The time-horizon can range from immediate, to long-term.
