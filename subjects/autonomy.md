# Autonomy

Autonomy does not imply absolute control. Rather, it revolves around influence and agency over thoughts and behaviour



> Any mortal subject is bound by its environment.

A subject exists in an environment. Their agency is bounded by external factors.

- Internal body. E.g. [emotions](../collaboration/emotions.md) that affect experience.
- Social environment. Other subjects.
- External environment. E.g. restrictions of movement.



Layers of freedom.

- Autonomy over private life.
- Autonomy over public life.
- Freedom of thoughts, desires, emotions. Celebration of diversity versus the need to suppress them.



Boundaries in society.

- Definitions of personhood and citizenship.
- Dehumanization



Human rights may be temporarily bended for the sake of:

- Emergency states. E.g. a health crisis
- Critical threats. E.g. terrorism.
