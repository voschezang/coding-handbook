Comfort can be physical, psychological, social or intellectual. See [domains](../metaphysics/domains.md).

- The absense of pain.
- Absense of stress. Low [potential energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_energy).
- The absense of (theoretical) risks. E.g. standing in front of a doorway is more dangerous than standing in front of a sturdy wall.
