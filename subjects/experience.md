# Experience

Subjects and agents have experience: *What it is like to be you.*

In philosophy, there is a distinction between a (human) subject and a zombie. The latter does not experience anything.

## Hierarchy

Behaviour and context:

- Context. The surroundings of the subject. *Where are you?*
- Its activity. *What are you doing?*

Interal experience:

- Its attention. Thinking, feeling or observing (awareness of something). 
- The object of attention. E.g. another subject. *Where is your attention? What's on your mind? What do you feel?*
- Its desire. *What would you like? What is attracting you?*



Type of subjects

- For people, experience consists of feelings and thoughts. Atrraction is guided by desire.

- For robots, experience consists of activity, attention and attraction.

## Attitude

The experience of an agent can be positive or negative. The agent may judge observations.



A neutral attitude is to tolerate the enviornment.
