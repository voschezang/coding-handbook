## Identity Levels

An organization may define itself on different levels. Based on Bateson's pyramid.

1. Meaning. Awareness of identity. What should our identity be?
2. Identity. Who are we?
3. Values. Give this identity, what do we value?
4. Beliefs. How do these values relate to the real world.
5. Capability. What are we capable of doing?
6. Behavior. What are we doing?
7. Environment. What is outside of us?

Identity influences decisions. For example, belief is a prerequisite for making changes - and it can limit capability.

E.g.

```markdown
**We      can    do         this     here**
_identity belief capability behavior environment_
```

It also influences the rights a subject beliefs to have. E.g. to live in a certain country.



## Perception of self

## Self and Other

Terms

- Self. The subject themselves.
- Other. Other subjects and the environment.



A distinction between the [self](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self) (internal) and its environment (external). E.g. a *subject* and the non-subject.

The Self or subject can be:

- Aristotle's essence or spirit: our underlying self.
- Subject of though: Cartesian Ego (observer of the world, body as an interface).
- [Being-in-the-world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dasein): the coherence of the self and the reset of the world.

[Multiplicity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posthuman) of selves. Identification with each role is dynamic. "I was not myself". Time flies.
