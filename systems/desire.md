# Organizational Desire and Needs

The purpose of the system differs for each perspective.

[toc]

## Functional view

A single core purpose. Either:

- **Processor**. Process (produce) information or materials and *transform* them. E.g. components in a value chain.
- **Storage**. Store valuable objects and retrieve them at a later point in *time*.
- **Platform**. *Facilitate* service providers and consumers. See [platform management](../organization/platform.md).

## Evolutionary view

The objective changes over time. From exploration to expansion to preservation.

| Phase                 | Objective            | Format      | Why                        |
| --------------------- | -------------------- | ----------- | -------------------------- |
| 1. ðŸŒ± **Exploration**  | Positioning          | Starting up | Find an existential reason |
| 2. ðŸª´ **Expansion**    | Integration          | Scaling up  | Fulfill the reason         |
| 3. ðŸŒ³ **Preservation** | Avoid disintegration | Sustaining  | Stay viable                |

## Social view

These phases can be mapped to a [hierarchy of needs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs).

Progress toward higher layers is done through gaining power, creating structure, optimization, and creating values. Note that progression towards spirituality or impulsion is not inherently good. It is useful in a specific environment and it has side-effects.

## Component view

Components can be treated both as subjects and as organized structures.

- Subjects have two types of desires: satisfaction and improved quality. See [subjects/desire.md](../subjects/desire.md).
- Organizations have a function, a lifecycle and exhibits internal dynamics.
