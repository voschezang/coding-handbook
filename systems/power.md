# Power

See also [control](../control.md).

Decisions are made and forwarded according to a [chain of command](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_hierarchy). This power structure may be:

- Explicit or implicit.
- Based on static rules.
- Centralized or distributed.
- Value of individuals in relation to the value of the organization.
- Tight or loose coupled. E.g. by formulating requests based on input, output or outcomes. E.g.
  - *"Execute these steps."*
  - *"Solve this problem by building feature X"*
  - *"Find a way to ensure that a user can achieve Y"*
  - *"We would like to have Z"*



Power in organizations can follow several [patterns](https://scholar.google.nl/scholar?hl=nl&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=+A+typology+of+organisational+cultures+-+Westrum&btnG=). Based on the flow of information, the following categories can be distinguished.

1. **Authoritative** (pathological): Strive for <u>power</u>. Follow chain of command. Compete for individual gain.
2. **Bureaucratic**: Ensure fairness and resilience through <u>rules</u>. Maintain the status quo. Obey rules and policies.
3. **Generative**: Strive for (group) <u>performance</u>. Be pragmatic and productive. Positive power.
4. **Idealistic**: Prioritize ideals and values over individuals. Shared (higher) purpose.



These categories have the following properties.

|                    | Authoritative                                      | Bureaucratic                                                 | Generative                              | Idealistic                    |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Bias**           | Power                                              | Rules                                                        | Performance                             | Value                         |
| **Purpose**        | (Individual) Power.                                | Fairness, protection, stability.                             | Effectiveness, outcomes.                | Follow ideals.                |
| **Type of Power**  | Mixed                                              | *Negative* power                                             | *Positive* power                        | Ideals > power                |
| **Responsibility** | Chain of command.                                  | Narrow, but explicit                                         | Shared                                  | Shared                        |
| **Scale**          | Limited                                            | Global                                                       | Global, but unstable                    | Global, but limited cohesion. |
| **Risks**          | Hide information from competitors. Suppress risks. | Slow, difficult to adapt. Bias for status quo. Lack of individual freedom. | Disruptive, unstable. Bias for metrics. | Unrealistic expectations      |

Risks to individual freedom.

- In bureaucratic organizations, individual freedom is subordinate to organizational goals and rules.

- In generative (achievement) organizations, individual freedom is subordinate to productivity.



These layers map to layers of [desire](desire.md).

Another extreme is an organic organization. Here, the survival and thriving of the organization is valued more than it's external utility.



**Types of power**

Note that rules can be set both by a central power and they may emerge from communities. Rules can be enforced explicitly (disciplinary) or implicitly - e.g. through surveillance.

|             | Negative Power       | Positive Power                |
| ----------- | -------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Focus**   | Obey rules           | Empowerment to achieve goals  |
| **Utility** | Fair rules           | Resources, to ensure autonomy |
| **Avoid**   | Sins                 | Unproductive thoughts         |
| **Risk**    | Society > individual | Productivity > freedom        |



## Society

Power structures in organiations of society may show the following types.

- Power based societies. Castes.
  - E.g. forms of feudalism and capitalism. A working class and a ruling class.
- Hierarchy. Bureaucracies. Boundaries are made up of designed rules. They are more fine-grained than castes.
  - Incentive to move up the corporate ladder.
  - E.g. the catholic church, the military, governments.
- Meritocracy. Performance based societies. Bias for individual performance. Individuals get the responsibility to choose their own path.



**History**

In history, power has had different forms.

- In an autocracy.
  - Control of land grants power. To allow exploitation the land itself, of merchants, workers.
  - Control of virtual land grants power. E.g. communication channels.

- In free markets.
  - Production power. Future wealth.
  - Wealth. To attract capabilities.



**Trinity**

Institutions and roles that grant power.

- üëë The crown. A king. Power given by strength.
- üôè The church. A priest. Power given by faith (trust).
- üí∞ Trade networks. A merchant. Power given through currency and logistics.



**Balance**

In democracies, parties may co-exist in a symbiotic-like state. One needs other.

- Conservatives and progressives. Advocate for stability versus change.
- Populists and bad conservatives. Populists presents themselves as saviours of the poor goverment policies (as underdog). The conservatives needs the thread of populists to justify their power.
