# Relations

A system or organization can be understood as a [network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_theory) of components. In case of a system of agents this provides a social view. See also [scale](../alignment/scale.md) and [structure](structure.md). See also [functions & relations.md](domain-modelling/functions-relations.md) and personal [relations](../psychology/relations.md).

## Top-down or Bottom-up

In theory, information flows top-down and a bottom-up. Top-down commands are typically directive, while bottom-up input is more neutral. See [commands and event messages](../software-industry/commands-events-messages.md).

These different approaches are called [orchestration and choreography](../alignment/orchestration-choreography.md) in IT.

### Networks

Authoritative power structures tend to be hierarchical and top down. The other structures are more distributed.
